Got it, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I need to remember how to compute line integrals with respect to arc length (ds). 

First, I recall that for a line segment parameterized by a parameter t, we can write the position vector r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), where x(t), y(t), z(t) are linear functions of t. The parameter t usually goes from a to b, and ds = ||r'(t)|| dt. So the first step is to parameterize the curve C.

Let's find the parameterization. The line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) can be parameterized as follows: let t go from 0 to 1 (or 0 to some length, but usually 0 to 1 for simplicity). Then:

x(t) = 0 + t*(6 - 0) = 6t
y(t) = 6 + t*(3 - 6) = 6 - 3t
z(t) = 4 + t*(3 - 4) = 4 - t

That makes sense because when t=0, we're at (0,6,4), and when t=1, we're at (6,3,3). Good.

Next, we need to compute the derivative r'(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt). Let's do that:

dx/dt = d(6t)/dt = 6
dy/dt = d(6 - 3t)/dt = -3
dz/dt = d(4 - t)/dt = -1

Now, the speed is the magnitude of r'(t), which is ||r'(t)|| = sqrt( (6)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). That's a constant, which is nice because then ds = ||r'(t)|| dt = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of [x(t)]³ z(t) * ||r'(t)|| dt. Let's substitute x(t), z(t), and ||r'(t)||:

x(t) = 6t, so x³ = (6t)³ = 216t³
z(t) = 4 - t
||r'(t)|| = sqrt(46)

So putting it all together, the integral is ∫₀¹ (216t³)(4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt. We can factor out the constant sqrt(46), so it's sqrt(46) times ∫₀¹ (216t³(4 - t)) dt. Let's compute the integral inside first: ∫₀¹ 216t³(4 - t) dt = 216 ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Let's compute the integral of 4t³ - t⁴: the antiderivative is 4*(t⁴/4) - t⁵/5 = t⁴ - t⁵/5. Evaluated from 0 to 1: [1⁴ - 1⁵/5] - [0] = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Then multiply by 216: 216*(4/5) = 864/5.

So the entire integral is sqrt(46) * (864/5) = (864 sqrt(46))/5. Let me check if that's simplified. 864 divided by... let's see, 864/5 is already a fraction, and 46 is square-free, so that's the simplest form.

Wait, let me double-check the parameterization. Let's confirm the direction: from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). The direction vector is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1), which matches the derivatives dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1. Good.

The speed is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), correct. Then x³ z is (6t)^3*(4 - t) = 216t³(4 - t). Multiply by sqrt(46) dt, integrate from 0 to 1. The integral of 216t³(4 - t) dt is 216*(4t⁴/4 - t⁵/5) from 0 to 1 = 216*(t⁴ - t⁵/5) from 0 to 1 = 216*(1 - 1/5) = 216*(4/5) = 864/5. Then multiply by sqrt(46): 864 sqrt(46)/5. That looks right.

Is there any other way to parameterize? Maybe using a different parameter, but since it's a line segment, the result should be the same. The key steps are parameterizing the curve, finding the derivative for ds, substituting into the integral, and computing.

Now, for the JSON output, the problem is an open-ended question (since it's to evaluate the integral), so the main answer is the value of the integral. The scratchwork should show the steps briefly, but according to the instructions, scratchwork_answer should have TTS-ready values, so maybe the key steps like parameterization, speed, substitution, integral computation.

Wait, the JSON requires "main_answer" and "scratchwork_answer". The main answer is the final value, which is (864 sqrt(46))/5. The scratchwork should show how we got there. Let's see:

Scratchwork: Parameterize C as r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t), 0≤t≤1. Then r'(t) = (6, -3, -1), ||r'(t)|| = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46). The integral becomes ∫₀¹ (6t)^3*(4-t)*sqrt(46) dt = sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ 216t³(4-t) dt. Compute ∫ 216t³(4-t) dt = 216 ∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt = 216 [t⁴ - t⁵/5] from 0 to 1 = 216*(1 - 1/5) = 864/5. So total integral is 864 sqrt(46)/5.

But according to the scratchwork_answer format, we need to put the essential calculation results. So maybe in the scratchwork_answer.values, we put the intermediate steps as TTS-ready. For example: "Integral of 216t³(4-t) dt from 0 to 1 is 864/5; multiplied by sqrt(46) gives 864 sqrt(46)/5"

But the instructions say scratchwork_answer values are TTS semantic, so maybe: "Integral of 216t cubed times (4 - t) dt from 0 to 1 equals 864 over 5; multiplied by square root of 46 equals 864 square root of 46 over 5"

The main answer is the final value: "864 times square root of 46 divided by 5"

Now, checking the JSON structure: problem_number is probably "1" since it's a single problem. problem_statement is the given one. question_type is "open_ended". math_content_check is "yes". final_answers has main_answer (single_value) with type, values, and answer_format. scratchwork_answer (values, answer_format).

So putting it all together:

{
  "problem_number": "1",
  "problem_statement": "Evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3).",
  "question_type": "open_ended",
  "math_content_check": "yes",
  "final_answers": {
    "main_answer": {
      "type": "single_value",
      "values": ["864 times square root of 46 divided by 5"],
      "answer_format": "tts_ready"
    },
    "scratchwork_answer": {
      "values": ["Parameterized C: r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t), 0≤t≤1; r'(t) = (6, -3, -1); ||r'(t)|| = sqrt(46); integral = ∫₀¹ (6t)^3*(4-t)*sqrt(46) dt = sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ 216t³(4-t) dt; ∫ 216t³(4-t) dt = 216*(t⁴ - t⁵/5) from 0 to 1 = 864/5; total integral = 864 sqrt(46)/5"],
      "answer_format": "tts_ready"
    }
  }
}

Wait, but the scratchwork_answer values should be TTS-ready, so maybe more natural language. Let's adjust the scratchwork_answer.values to use natural flow:

"For the line integral, we parameterize the curve C from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) as r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t) where t goes from 0 to 1. The derivative r'(t) is (6, -3, -1), so the speed ||r'(t)|| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(46). The integral becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of (6t)^3*(4-t)*sqrt(46) dt. Simplifying (6t)^3 gives 216t³, so the integrand is 216t³(4-t)sqrt(46). The integral of 216t³(4-t) dt from 0 to 1 is 216 times the integral of (4t³ - t⁴) dt, which is 216*(t⁴ - t⁵/5) evaluated at 1 and 0, giving 216*(1 - 1/5) = 864/5. Multiplying by sqrt(46) gives the final result: 864 sqrt(46)/5."

But according to the example 4, the scratchwork_answer.values are the essential calculation results, not explanations. So maybe:

"Integral of 216t³(4-t) dt from 0 to 1 equals 864/5; multiplied by square root of 46 gives 864 square root of 46 over 5"

Yes, that's more in line with the examples. The main answer is the final value, which is 864 sqrt(46)/5.

Let me confirm the math again: 216t³(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴. Integral from 0 to 1: [864*(t⁴/4) - 216*(t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1 = (864/4) - (216/5) = 216 - 43.2 = 172.8, which is 864/5 (since 864/5 = 172.8). Correct. Then multiply by sqrt(46): 172.8 * sqrt(46) = 864/5 * sqrt(46). So that's correct.

So the final JSON should be as above, with the main answer being the simplified integral value and the scratchwork showing the key steps.
