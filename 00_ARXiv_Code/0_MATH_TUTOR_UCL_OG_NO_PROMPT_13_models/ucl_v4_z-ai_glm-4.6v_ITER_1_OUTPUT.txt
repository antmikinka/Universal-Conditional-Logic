=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to solve this line integral problem. Let me analyze the problem:

The problem asks to evaluate the line integral:
∫_C x³z ds

Where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3).

To solve this, I need to:
1. Parameterize the line segment C
2. Express x, y, z in terms of the parameter
3. Compute ds in terms of the parameter
4. Set up and evaluate the integral

Let me parameterize the line segment. I'll use t as the parameter, where t goes from 0 to 1.

The starting point is (0, 6, 4) and the ending point is (6, 3, 3).

The parameterization would be:
x = 0 + 6t = 6t
y = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t
z = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

Now I need to find ds. For a parametric curve r(t) = <x(t), y(t), z(t)>, we have:
ds = √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²] dt

Let me compute the derivatives:
dx/dt = 6
dy/dt = -3
dz/dt = -1

So:
ds = √[(6)² + (-3)² + (-1)²] dt = √[36 + 9 + 1] dt = √46 dt

Now I can set up the integral:
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4-t) √46 dt

Let me simplify this:
= √46 ∫_0^1 216t³(4-t) dt
= 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt
= 216√46 [4(t⁴/4) - (t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1
= 216√46 [t⁴ - t⁵/5] from 0 to 1
= 216√46 [1 - 1/5]
= 216√46 [4/5]
= (864/5)√46

Let me double-check this calculation:
216 × 4/5 = 864/5, so yes.

So the final answer is (864/5)√46.

Let me verify this step by step:
1. Parameterization: x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t, t ∈ [0, 1] ✓
2. Derivatives: dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1 ✓
3. ds = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46 ✓
4. Integral setup: ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4-t)√46 dt ✓
5. Simplification: 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt ✓
6. Integration: 216√46 [t⁴ - t⁵/5] from 0 to 1 ✓
7. Evaluation: 216√46 [1 - 1/5] = 216√46 × 4/5 = 864√46/5 ✓

The calculation seems correct.
