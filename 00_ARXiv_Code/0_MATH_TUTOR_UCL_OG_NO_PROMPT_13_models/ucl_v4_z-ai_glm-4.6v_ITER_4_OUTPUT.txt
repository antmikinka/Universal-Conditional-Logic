=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral: the integral over C of x cubed z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3).

First, I need to parameterize the line segment C. The line segment goes from point A(0, 6, 4) to point B(6, 3, 3).

A parameterization of a line segment from point A to point B can be given by:
r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So:
r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)

Therefore:
x = 6t
y = 6-3t  
z = 4-t

Now I need to find ds. For a parametric curve r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), we have:
ds = √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²] dt

dx/dt = 6
dy/dt = -3
dz/dt = -1

So:
ds = √[(6)² + (-3)² + (-1)²] dt = √[36 + 9 + 1] dt = √46 dt

Now I can set up the integral:
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4-t) √46 dt

Let me simplify:
(6t)³ = 216t³
So: ∫_0^1 216t³(4-t) √46 dt = 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt

Now I integrate:
∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5

Therefore:
216√46 × 4/5 = (864/5)√46

Let me double-check this calculation:
216 × 4/5 = 864/5
So the final answer is (864/5)√46

Actually, let me verify the integral again:
∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5 ✓

And 216 × 4/5 = 864/5 ✓

So the line integral evaluates to (864/5)√46.
