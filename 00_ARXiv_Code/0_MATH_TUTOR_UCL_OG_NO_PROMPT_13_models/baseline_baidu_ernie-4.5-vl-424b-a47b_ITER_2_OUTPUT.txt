We are evaluating the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds
 where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

 Steps:
 1. Parameterize the line segment.
 2. Find the magnitude of the derivative of the parameterization (for ds).
 3. Express the integral in terms of the parameter.

 Parameterization:
 Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
 Then:
   x(t) = (1-t)*0 + t*6 = 6t
   y(t) = (1-t)*6 + t*3 = 6 - 3t
   z(t) = (1-t)*4 + t*3 = 4 - t

 So, the parametric equations are:
   x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

 Now, find the derivative with respect to t:
   dx/dt = 6
   dy/dt = -3
   dz/dt = -1

 Then, the magnitude of the derivative vector is:
   ||dr/dt|| = √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²] 
             = √[6² + (-3)² + (-1)²] 
             = √[36 + 9 + 1] 
             = √46

 Therefore, ds = √46 dt.

 Now, express the integral:
   ∫_C x³ z ds = ∫_{t=0}^{1} (x(t))³ * z(t) * √46 dt
               = ∫_0^1 (6t)^3 * (4 - t) * √46 dt
               = ∫_0^1 216 t³ (4 - t) √46 dt
               = 216 √46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt

 Compute the integral:
   ∫(4t³ - t⁴) dt from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1? Actually:
     = [ (4*(t^4/4)) - (t^5/5) ] from 0 to 1   [But 4t^3 integrates to t^4?]
     Actually: ∫4t³ dt = t^4, ∫t^4 dt? Wait, no: ∫4t³ dt = 4*(t^4/4)=t^4, and ∫t^4 dt? Actually the term is 4t^3 and -t^4? Wait the expression is 4t³ - t⁴? Then:
     ∫(4t³ - t⁴) dt = 4*(t^4/4) - (t^5/5) = t^4 - (1/5)t^5

 Evaluate from 0 to 1: [1^4 - (1/5)*1^5] - [0] = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

 So, the integral becomes:
   = 216 √46 * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) √46 = 864/5 √46

 We can simplify 864/5 = 172.8, but better to leave as fraction.

 Alternatively, 864 ÷ 5 = 864/5, so we can write as (864/5) √46.

 But we can simplify 864/5? It's already in simplest form? Actually 864 and 5 are coprime? 5 is prime and 864 not divisible by 5? So 864/5 is 172.8 but for exact, we leave as fraction.

 However, note: 864/5 = 172.8, but in fraction form is 864/5. We can also write as a mixed number? But for math, fraction is fine.

 Alternatively, 864/5 = 172.8, but we can factor 864? Actually no need. The answer is 864√46 / 5.

 Now, convert to TTS format.

 But note: the question is to output in the required JSON format. We are to provide the main answer in TTS-ready format and scratchwork.

 However, the problem is an open-ended calculation. The final answer is a number.

 But the requirement: 
   "final_answers": {
      "main_answer": { ... },
      "scratchwork_answer": { ... }

 We have:
   main_answer: the value of the integral in TTS-ready form.

 Since it's a single value, we'll use type "single_value".

 We have: (864√46)/5

 We can write it as a fraction: 864 times the square root of 46, over 5.

 In TTS: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, all over five"

 Alternatively, we can compute the numerical value? But the problem doesn't specify, and since it's exact form, we leave as fraction.

 However, note the scratchwork: we need to show key steps.

 For scratchwork, we are to put essential intermediate results in TTS-ready semantic mathematical language.

 Steps for scratchwork:

 1. Parameterize the line segment: 
      x(t) = 6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t, for t in [0,1]
      (We can say: "Parameter t from 0 to 1: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t")

 2. Derivative magnitude: 
      dr/dt = <6, -3, -1>, ||dr/dt|| = square root of (6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared) = square root of 46
      (TTS: "Derivative vector: 6 comma negative 3 comma negative 1; magnitude: square root of 46")

 3. Substitute into the integral:
      Integral becomes: integral from 0 to 1 of (6t) cubed times (4-t) times square root of 46 dt
      = integral from 0 to 1 of 216 t cubed times (4 - t) square root of 46 dt
      = 216 square root of 46 times integral from 0 to 1 of (4t cubed - t to the fourth) dt

 4. Compute the integral of the polynomial:
      Integral of 4t^3 - t^4: 
          = 4*(t^4/4) - (t^5/5) evaluated from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0) = 4/5

 5. Therefore: 216 * √46 * 4/5 = (864/5) √46

 Now, we will write the scratchwork in a list of key steps.

 Since the scratchwork_answer expects a list of strings, each being a TTS-ready phrase.

 However, note the requirement: 
   "scratchwork_answer": {
        "values": ["key_step1", "key_step2", ...],
        "answer_format": "tts_ready"
   }

 We will break the steps similarly.

 But note: the example has a single string per step? Actually, in example 4, each value in scratchwork is a string that is a full sentence.

 We'll do:

   Step 1: "Parameterize the line segment with t from 0 to 1: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t"
   Step 2: "Derivative: dx over dt equals 6, dy over dt equals negative 3, dz over dt equals negative 1; magnitude equals square root of 46"
   Step 3: "Integral becomes: integral from 0 to 1 of the quantity 6t cubed, times the quantity 4 minus t, times square root of 46, dt"
   Step 4: "Simplify: 216 square root of 46 times integral from 0 to 1 of 4t cubed minus t to the fourth, dt"
   Step 5: "Compute the integral: integral of 4t cubed minus t to the fourth, dt from 0 to 1 equals 4/5"
   Step 6: "Final result: 216 square root of 46 times 4/5 equals 864 square root of 46 over 5"

 But the scratchwork should be concise. We can combine.

 Alternatively, we can write:

   [0] Parameter t from 0 to 1: x = 6t, y = 6-3t, z = 4-t
   [1] Derivative magnitude: sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(46)
   [2] Integral: ∫[0,1] (6t)^3 * (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt = ∫[0,1] 216t^3(4-t)sqrt(46) dt
   [3] = 216 sqrt(46) ∫[0,1] (4t^3 - t^4) dt
   [4] ∫(4t^3 - t^4) dt = t^4 - (1/5)t^5 |[0,1] = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5
   [5] Answer: (216 * 4/5) sqrt(46) = 864 sqrt(46) / 5

 But for TTS, we write in natural language.

 However, the requirement says: 
   "values": ["key_step1", "key_step2", ...]

 We'll write each step as a string.

 Final answer for main_answer: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, all over five"

 But note: the problem_statement in the example is given. Here, we have the problem: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

 We'll put that as problem_statement.

 But the output must be JSON.

 Let's construct the JSON.

 Note: the question_type is "open_ended".

 Also, math_content_check: "yes"

 We are to output only JSON.

 Here is the JSON:
