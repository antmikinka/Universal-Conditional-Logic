=== REASONING / THINKING ===

We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 We parameterize the line segment. Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
 Start point: (0,6,4) → when t=0
 End point: (6,3,3) → when t=1

 So, we can write:
 x(t) = 0 + (6-0)t = 6t
 y(t) = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t
 z(t) = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

 Now, we need the arc length differential ds.
 We know: ds = |dr/dt| dt, where r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))
 So, dr/dt = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) = (6, -3, -1)

 Then, |dr/dt| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36+9+1) = √46

 Therefore, ds = √46 dt.

 The integral becomes:
 ∫_0^1 [x(t)]³ * z(t) * √46 dt
 = ∫_0^1 (6t)³ * (4 - t) * √46 dt
 = √46 ∫_0^1 216 t³ (4 - t) dt

 We can factor out the constants: 216 and √46.
 = 216 √46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt

 Now, compute the integral:
 ∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [4*(t⁴/4) - (t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1
 = [t⁴ - (1/5)t⁵] from 0 to 1
 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5

 Therefore, the integral = 216 √46 * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) √46
 = (864 / 5) √46

 We can leave it as a fraction times the square root.

 However, note that the problem asks for the evaluation. We can also compute the numerical value if needed, but the exact form is acceptable.

 But let's write it as a simplified expression.

 Since 864 and 5 are co-prime? Actually, 864/5 is already simplified. So:

 ∫_C x³ z ds = (864/5) √46

 Alternatively, we can write it as (864 √46) / 5.

 However, note that we might be able to simplify 864? But 864 is a constant. Alternatively, we can factor out common factors? There is no common factor between 5 and 864.

 Alternatively, we can compute the exact value:

 864 / 5 = 172.8, but we'll keep it as fraction.

 So, the final answer is (864 √46) / 5.

 But let me double-check the calculation:

 We had: 216 √46 * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) √46 = 864/5 √46.

 Alternatively, we can write it as (864√46)/5.

 However, if we want to be precise, we can leave it like that.

 But note: 216 * 4 = 864, so yes.

 We'll box the answer.

 But wait, let me verify the parameterization and the derivative.

 We have:
 r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)
 r'(t) = (6, -3, -1) → magnitude √(36+9+1)=√46, so ds=√46 dt. Correct.

 Then, x(t)=6t, z(t)=4-t, so x(t)^3 * z(t) = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t). Correct.

 Then, integral of 216 t^3 (4-t) from 0 to 1 = 216 ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 216 [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1 = 216 [1 - 1/5] = 216 * (4/5) = 864/5.

 Then multiply by √46: (864/5) √46.

 Alternatively, we can write it as a single fraction: (864 √46) / 5.

 We'll present the answer as such.

 However, note that the problem does not specify the form. So, we can also compute the numerical value, but the exact form is better.

 Therefore, the final answer is \( \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} \).

 But let me simplify: 864 and 5 have no common factors? 5 is prime and does not divide 864? Actually, 5 is prime and 864 is not a multiple of 5? 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, so no common factors. Therefore, it's simplified.

 Alternatively, we can write it as 172.8 √46, but fractional form is exact.

 So, we output the exact form.

 However, note that sometimes we can factor 864: 864 = 144 * 6, but that doesn't help with the denominator.

 Therefore, we'll box the answer as \( \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5} \).

 But wait, let me check: 864 and 5 are coprime? Yes, because 864 is 2^5 * 3^3 and 5 is prime and not in the factorization. So it's simplified.

 Alternatively, we can write it as \( \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} \).

 Both are the same.

 We'll output that.

### Solution for Line Integral Evaluation

The line integral to evaluate is:
\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds
\]
where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\).

#### Step 1: Parameterize the Line Segment
- Parametrize \(C\) using \(t\) from 0 to 1:
  - \(x(t) = 6t\)
  - \(y(t) = 6 - 3t\)
  - \(z(t) = 4 - t\)

#### Step 2: Compute \(ds\)
- Derivative of \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\):
  \[
  \mathbf{r}'(t) = \left( \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt} \right) = (6, -3, -1)
  \]
- Magnitude:
  \[
  \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}
  \]
- Thus:
  \[
  ds = \sqrt{46}  dt
  \]

#### Step 3: Substitute into the Integral
- Integrand in terms of \(t\):
  \[
  x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4
  \]
- Integral becomes:
  \[
  \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt
  \]
- Factor out constants:
  \[
  \sqrt{46} \cdot 216 \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = 216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt
  \]

#### Step 4: Integrate with Respect to \(t\)
- Compute the integral:
  \[
  \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) - 0 = \frac{4}{5}
  \]
- Multiply by constant:
  \[
  216\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}
  \]

#### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{864\,\sqrt{46}}{5}}
\]
