=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The user wants to evaluate ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I need to parameterize the curve C.

A line segment between two points can be parameterized using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula is r(t) = (1-t)P + tQ, where P and Q are the endpoints. So here, P is (0,6,4) and Q is (6,3,3).

Let me compute r(t):

x(t) = 0 + t(6 - 0) = 6t

y(t) = 6 + t(3 - 6) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 + t(3 - 4) = 4 - t

So r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t in [0,1].

Next, I need to find ds, which is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) times dt. Let's compute r'(t):

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude ||r'(t)|| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integrand is x³ z. Substitute x(t) and z(t):

x³ z = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴.

Now the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt.

Factor out sqrt(46):

sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt

Compute the integral term by term:

∫864 t³ dt = 864 * (t⁴/4) = 216 t⁴

∫216 t⁴ dt = 216 * (t⁵/5) = (216/5) t⁵

Evaluate from 0 to 1:

[216(1)^4 - (216/5)(1)^5] - [0] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5

Multiply by sqrt(46):

(864/5) * sqrt(46)

So the final answer is (864√46)/5.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Let's verify the integral steps:

864 t³ integral from 0 to1 is 864*(1/4) = 216.

216 t⁴ integral is 216*(1/5) = 43.2.

So 216 - 43.2 = 172.8. Which is 864/5 = 172.8. Yes, that's correct. Then multiply by sqrt(46).

So the result is 864√46 /5.
