=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to remember how to compute a line integral over a line segment. The line integral here is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I should parameterize the line segment. Let's recall that a line segment from point A to point B can be parameterized as r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t goes from 0 to 1. So let's find the vector from A to B. A is (0,6,4), B is (6,3,3). So B - A is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization is r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t in [0,1]. 

Next, we need to find ds, which is the arc length element. The formula for ds is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, times dt. So first, compute r'(t). The derivative of r(t) is (6, -3, -1). Then the magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, we need to express x, y, z in terms of t. From the parameterization, x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t. So substitute these into the integrand: x³z = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216t³ * (4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴.

Now, the line integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt. We can factor out sqrt(46) since it's a constant. So that's sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt.

Let's compute the integral of 864t³ - 216t⁴. The antiderivative of 864t³ is 864*(t⁴/4) = 216t⁴. The antiderivative of -216t⁴ is -216*(t⁵/5) = -216t⁵/5. So evaluating from 0 to 1: [216(1)⁴ - 216(1)⁵/5] - [0 - 0] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5.

Then multiply by sqrt(46): (864/5) * sqrt(46). Let's check if that's correct. Wait, let's verify the parameterization again. The line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3): yes, the direction vector is (6, -3, -1), so parameterization is correct. The derivative is (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), correct. Then x=6t, z=4-t, so x³z=(6t)^3*(4-t)=216t³*(4-t)=864t³-216t⁴, correct. The integral of 864t³ is 864*(t^4/4)=216t^4, integral of -216t^4 is -216*(t^5/5), so at t=1, 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5, correct. Then multiply by sqrt(46), so the result is (864/5)sqrt(46). Let me check if that can be simplified, but 864 and 5 have no common factors, so that's the simplified form.
