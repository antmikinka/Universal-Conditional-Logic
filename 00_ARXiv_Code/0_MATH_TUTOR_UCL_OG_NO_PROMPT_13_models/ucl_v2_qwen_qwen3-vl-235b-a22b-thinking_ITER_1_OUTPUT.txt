=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). Hmm, line integrals of scalar functions... right, the formula is ∫_C f(x, y, z) ds = ∫_a^b f(r(t)) ||r'(t)|| dt, where r(t) is the parameterization of the curve C.

First, I need to parameterize the line segment. The general way to parameterize a line segment between two points P and Q is r(t) = P + t(Q - P) where t goes from 0 to 1. Let me write down the points: starting point is (0, 6, 4), ending point is (6, 3, 3). So the vector from start to end is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization should be r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t in [0,1].

Let me check that. When t=0, it's (0,6,4), correct. When t=1, it's (6,3,3), perfect. Now, next step is to compute r'(t). Taking the derivative with respect to t: r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). Then, the magnitude ||r'(t)|| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). That's a constant, which is good because it simplifies the integral.

Now, the function to integrate is x³ z. Let's express x and z in terms of t. From the parameterization: x = 6t, z = 4 - t. So x³ z = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Let me expand that: 216*(4t³ - t⁴) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴.

So the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of [864 t³ - 216 t⁴] * sqrt(46) dt. Since sqrt(46) is a constant, I can factor it out: sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt.

Now compute the integral of 864 t³ -216 t⁴. The antiderivative of t³ is (t⁴)/4, so 864*(t⁴/4) = 216 t⁴. The antiderivative of t⁴ is t⁵/5, so -216*(t⁵/5) = - (216/5) t⁵. Evaluate from 0 to 1:

At t=1: 216*(1)^4 - (216/5)*(1)^5 = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5.

At t=0: 0 - 0 = 0. So the integral part is 864/5.

Multiply by sqrt(46): total integral is (864/5) * sqrt(46). Let me check if that's correct. Wait, let me verify the steps again.

Wait, the parameterization: x = 6t, correct. z = 4 - t, correct. Then x³ z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴, yes. Then the integral of that from 0 to1 is [864*(t^4/4) - 216*(t^5/5)] from 0 to1 = [216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5] from 0 to1 = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by ||r'(t)|| which is sqrt(46). So the final answer is (864/5) sqrt(46). Let me compute 864 divided by 5: 172.8, but as a fraction it's 864/5. So the answer is (864√46)/5.

Wait, let me check if I did the parameterization correctly. Sometimes people use different parameters, but t from 0 to1 is standard. The derivative is correct: (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36 +9 +1)=sqrt(46). Yes. The substitution of x and z in terms of t is correct. The integral setup seems right. So the calculation should be correct. I think that's the answer.
