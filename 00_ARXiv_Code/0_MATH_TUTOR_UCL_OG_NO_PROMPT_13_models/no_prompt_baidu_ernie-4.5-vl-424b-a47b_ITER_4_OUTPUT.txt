I need to evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I recall that for a line integral with respect to arc length, I need to parameterize the curve C and then compute the integral using ds.

The curve is a straight line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). I can parameterize this line segment. Let t be a parameter that goes from 0 to 1. When t=0, I'm at (0,6,4), and when t=1, I'm at (6,3,3).

The vector from the start point to the end point is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So, the parametric equations should be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t

y(t) = 6 + (-3)t = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 + (-1)t = 4 - t

So, r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t from 0 to 1.

Now, for the line integral ∫ f(x,y,z) ds, where f(x,y,z) = x³ z, and ds is the arc length element.

I know that ds = |r'(t)| dt.

So, I need to find r'(t). The derivative of r(t) is:

dx/dt = 6

dy/dt = -3

dz/dt = -1

So, r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude |r'(t)| = sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

Since the components are constants, |r'(t)| is constant, which makes things easier. So, |r'(t)| = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

36 + 9 is 45, plus 1 is 46, yes. So, |r'(t)| = sqrt(46)

Now, the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of f(x(t),y(t),z(t)) * |r'(t)| dt

f(x,y,z) = x³ z

So, f(x(t),y(t),z(t)) = [x(t)]³ * z(t) = (6t)^3 * (4 - t)

Compute that: (6t)^3 = 216 t^3

So, 216 t^3 * (4 - t) = 216 (4t^3 - t^4)

(6t)^3 is 6^3 * t^3 = 216 t^3, yes.

Then multiplied by z(t) = 4 - t, so it's 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216 * 4 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

Now, multiply by |r'(t)| = sqrt(46)

So, the integral is ∫ from 0 to 1 of [864 t^3 - 216 t^4] * sqrt(46) dt

Since sqrt(46) is constant, I can factor it out.

So, ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46) dt = sqrt(46) ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt

Now, I need to compute the antiderivative.

Let me factor out 216 from the polynomial to simplify.

864 and 216, both divisible by 216? 864 / 216 = 4, and 216 / 216 = 1, so:

864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 (4 t^3 - t^4)

Yes, as I had earlier.

So, the integral is sqrt(46) * ∫_0^1 216 (4t^3 - t^4) dt

Now, 216 is constant, so:

= sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt

Now, compute the integral of (4t^3 - t^4) from 0 to 1.

Antiderivative of 4t^3 is 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4? No.

∫ 4t^3 dt = 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4? The 4 and 1/4 cancel? ∫ t^n dt = t^{n+1}/(n+1) for n≠-1.

So, ∫ 4t^3 dt = 4 * [t^4 / 4] = t^4? No:

d/dt (t^4 / 4) is t^3, but here it's 4 times that, no.

∫ 4t^3 dt = 4 * ∫ t^3 dt = 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4? ∫ t^3 dt = t^4 / 4, so 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4. Oh, yes, it simplifies to t^4.

Is that right? 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4, yes.

But when t=1, t^4=1, but let me confirm.

t^4 at t=1 is 1, but 4t^3 at t=1 is 4, so integral from 0 to 1 should be [t^4] from 0 to 1? No.

The antiderivative of 4t^3 is t^4? Let's see: derivative of t^4 is 4t^3, yes, so ∫ 4t^3 dt = t^4 + C.

Similarly, ∫ -t^4 dt = - (t^5 / 5) + C

So, antiderivative of 4t^3 - t^4 is t^4 - (t^5)/5

Now, evaluate from 0 to 1.

At t=1: 1^4 - (1^5)/5 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

At t=0: 0 - 0 = 0

So, ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 4/5

Now, back to the integral.

We have sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5)

From earlier: sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5)

Now, compute that.

First, 216 * 4 / 5

216 / 5 = 216/5, times 4 is 864/5? Or better to compute 216 * 4 = 864, then divided by 5, so 864 / 5

So, sqrt(46) * (864 / 5)

But I can write it as (864 / 5) * sqrt(46)

Now, simplify 864 / 5 and sqrt(46).

First, note that 864 and 5, 5 is prime, 864 divided by 5 is not integer, but I can leave it for now.

I can factor it.

Notice that in the expression, I have 216 * 4 / 5 * sqrt(46)

But earlier I had the polynomial as 216 (4t^3 - t^4), but after integration it's 216 * (4/5) for the definite integral part.

But 216 is from earlier, but I can simplify 216 and 4 and 5.

I recall that when I had f(x,y,z) ds, I multiplied by |r'(t)|, and I had 216 t^3 (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt, no.

Earlier step: after substituting, the integrand was [216 t^3 * (4 - t)] * sqrt(46) dt from 0 to 1.

216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216 (4t^3 - t^4), as before.

Then times sqrt(46) dt.

Integral is ∫_0^1 216 (4t^3 - t^4) sqrt(46) dt

Then I pulled out 216 sqrt(46), and then the integral is ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 1 - 1/5? No, earlier I got 4/5, but:

∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 is [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0) = 4/5, yes.

So total integral is 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5)

216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5

So, (864 / 5) * sqrt(46)

But I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

Now, I can simplify this fraction.

First, see if 864 and 5 have common factors. 5 is prime, 864 divisible by 2, but 5 is odd, so gcd is 1, so fraction is already simplified? 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, but it's fine, but I can write it as mixed number, but probably better to keep as fraction.

Notice that 864 and 5, but also I have sqrt(46), and 46=2*23, so no simplification there.

But earlier I had 216, which is 216, and 4, and 5.

I think I made a mistake.

The expression is 216 * (4/5) * sqrt(46) = (216 * 4 / 5) * sqrt(46) = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But 216 is 216, and 4 is 4, but in the integral, when I multiply, it's correct, but perhaps I can factor out more.

Notice that in f(x(t)) I had 216 t^3 (4-t), and |r'(t)| = sqrt(46), so the coefficient is 216 sqrt(46), and then the definite integral of (4t^3 - t^4) is 4/5.

But 216 is 216, but 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, but I recall that at the beginning, I had (6t)^3 = 216 t^3, but 6t is x(t), but perhaps I can write everything.

Another way: the entire integrand before dt is [x^3 z] |r'| dt = [ (6t)^3 * (4 - t) ] * sqrt(46) dt = 216 t^3 (4 - t) sqrt(46) dt

Then integrate 216 sqrt(46) ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1

Now, ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = as computed, 4/5

So yes.

Now, ∫ from 0 to 1 of (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}

So, the integral is 216 \sqrt{46} \times \frac{4}{5}

216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5

So, \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

To simplify, see if numerator and denominator have common factors, but 864 and 5, 5 is prime, 864 not divisible by 5? 864 / 5 = 172.8, not integer, so no, fraction is already simplified? 864 and 5 are coprime, yes.

But 864 can be simplified with what? No, it's a constant.

Notice that 864 / 5 = 172.8, but better to keep as fraction.

I could factor 864.

864 divided by 16? But no need.

Another thought: in the beginning, when I parameterized, I assumed t from 0 to 1, and everything is fine.

But let me double-check the parameterization.

Point at t=0: x=6*0=0, y=6-3*0=6, z=4-0=4, good.

t=1: x=6, y=6-3=3, z=4-1=3, good.

r'(t)=(6,-3,-1), magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), good.

f(x,y,z)=x^3 z

At some point, say t=0, f=0, but that's fine.

When I compute, for example at t=0.5, x=3, z=4-0.5=3.5, so f=27*3.5=94.5, but anyway.

Now, the integral is ∫ 216 (4t^3 - t^4) sqrt(46) dt from 0 to 1

216 (4t^3 - t^4) = 216*4 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

Then times sqrt(46), so integrand is sqrt(46) (864 t^3 - 216 t^4)

Now, integrate with respect to t.

Antiderivative: sqrt(46) ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1

= sqrt(46) [ 864 * (t^4 / 4) - 216 * (t^5 / 5) ] from 0 to 1

Simplify:

864 / 4 = 216, so 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4? No.

∫ 864 t^3 dt = 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4? 864 / 4 = 216, and t^4, so 216 t^4.

Earlier I had for 4t^3, but here it's different.

∫ 864 t^3 dt = 864 * \frac{t^4}{4} = 216 t^4? 864 / 4 = 216, so yes, 216 t^4.

But 216 is constant, but in terms of evaluation.

Similarly, ∫ -216 t^4 dt = -216 * \frac{t^5}{5} = -\frac{216}{5} t^5

So, antiderivative is sqrt(46) [ 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 ] from 0 to 1

Factor 216 sqrt(46) [ t^4 - \frac{1}{5} t^5 ] from 0 to 1? No.

[216 t^4 - 216/5 t^5] = 216 t^4 (1 - \frac{1}{5} t) ? But at evaluation, better to compute separately.

So, at t=1: 216 (1)^4 - \frac{216}{5} (1)^5 = 216 - 216/5 = 216 (1 - 1/5) = 216 * 4/5 = 864/5

At t=0: 0

So, [216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 ] at 1 is 216 - 216/5 = (216 * 5 - 216)/5 = 216(5-1)/5 = 216*4/5 = 864/5

Same as before.

Then multiplied by sqrt(46), so total integral is sqrt(46) * (864 / 5)

So, same as before.

Now, 864 / 5 is 172.8, but better to write as fraction.

Notice that 216 and the 216 in the expression, but it's fine.

I can write it as \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} but 216*4=864, same.

Perhaps simplify by factoring.

Notice that 216 = 216, and 4, but in the expression, it's already simplified.

I could write \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But 864 and 5 have no common factors, so this is fine.

Since 864 = 864, I can leave it.

But let me see if I can factor out something.

Another way: earlier I had after parameterization, the integral is ∫ f(x(t),y(t),z(t)) |r'(t)| dt = ∫_0^1 (6t)^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46}  dt

= ∫_0^1 216 t^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46}  dt

Same as before.

Now, ∫ t^3 (4 - t) dt from 0 to 1.

I can expand: ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5, as before.

So, 216 \sqrt{46} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, to write neatly, perhaps I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But 864 and 5, since 5 is in denominator, and 864 is integer, it's fine.

Notice that 864/5 = 172.8, but fraction is better.

I could write it as a mixed number, but no.

Another thought: in the parametric equation, when I define the parameter, I used t from 0 to 1, but sometimes people use the arc length parameter, but here it's not necessary since |r'| is constant.

But in this case, since |r'| is constant, it's straightforward.

Now, the final answer should be \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me confirm the numerical value to see if it makes sense.

First, sqrt(46) ≈ sqrt(49)=7, but 46 is less, sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, so say 6.7823 (since 6.78^2=45.9684, close, 6.782^2=46.00 something, actually 6.7823^2≈46.000, yes approx 6.7823)

Now, 864 / 5 = 172.8

172.8 * 6.7823 ≈ let's see, 170*6.7823=170*6.7823, first 100*6.7823=678.23, 70*6.7823≈70*6.782=474.74, total 678.23+474.74=1152.97, then 2.8*6.7823≈19, so total approx 1172, but wait, that can't be right because my function values are small.

f(x,z) at some points: at start, t=0, f=0, z=4, x=0, so 0.

At t=1, x=6, z=3, f=216*3=648? x^3=216, z=3, so 216*3=648.

The line segment, the magnitude of |r'| is sqrt(46)≈6.782, and length of segment is sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46)≈6.782, as I have.

The average value of f? Since it's from 0 to 648, but not linear, but roughly, average might be around 300 or so, times length 6.782≈2000 something? But my integral is about 172.8 * 6.782 ≈ let's compute: 170*6.782≈1152.94, 2.8*6.782≈19, total 1172, but at t=1, f is 648, and |r'| in dt, but since ds = |r'| dt, and dt from 0 to 1, so integral should be roughly average of f times ds, but ds is constant, same as length since |r'| constant.

Length of curve is |r'(t)| dt from 0 to 1, which is sqrt(46)≈6.782.

f at start 0, at end 648, but since it's a cubic times linear, maybe average is around 324 or so, but 324*6.782≈2200, but I got 1172, which is less, but at start it's zero, so perhaps average is less.

At t=0.5, x=3, z=4-0.5=3.5, x^3=27, so f=27*3.5=94.5

At t=0.5, but earlier I have the function as 216 t^3 (4-t), at t=0.5, 216*(0.125)*(3.5)=216*0.125=27, times 3.5=94.5, same.

Now, max might be around, but since x^3 grows, but z decreases, but at t=0.5, 94.5, at t=1, 648, but t=0.5 is 94.5, t=1 is 648, and since it's cubic, probably maximum before end.

Set derivative to find max, but for average, since starts at 0, ends at 648, but symmetric? t^3 (4-t), at t=0.5, 3.5, as above.

The function 4t^3 - t^4, which is t^3 (4-t), derivative 12t^2 - 4t^3 = 4t^2 (3 - t), so critical point at t=3, but out of range, in [0,1], increasing since derivative positive for t<3.

At t=0,0; t=1, 4-1=3? Wait no, f(x,z) but in terms of t, the value is 216 t^3 (4-t), so at t=0,0; t=0.5,216*(0.125)*(3.5)=216*0.4375? 0.125*3.5=0.4375, times 216.

0.125 is 1/8, 3.5 is 7/2, so (1/8)*(7/2)=7/16, times 216=216*7/16.

216/16=13.5, times 7=94.5, same.

At t=1, 216*1^3*(4-1)=216*3=648? Earlier I said x^3 z, z=4-t, at t=1, z=3, x=6, x^3=216, 216*3=648, yes.

But in the expression for the integrand, before multiplying by |r'|, it's x^3 z = 216 t^3 (4-t), as above.

Now, this function from 0 to 1: at t=0, 0; t=0.5,94.5; t=1,648. But 648 is at end, and it's increasing, but since |r'| is constant, the integral ∫ f ds = ∫ f |r'| dt, and |r'| constant, so same as |r'| times ∫ f dt.

∫ f(t) dt from 0 to 1 of 216 t^3 (4-t) dt = ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1, as before.

Integral of that is [216 t^4 - 216/5 t^5] wait no, earlier we had [216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 ]? From earlier calculation, but that was the antiderivative before multiplication.

The function g(t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

∫ g(t) dt from 0 to 1 = ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = 864*(t^4/4) - 216*(t^5/5) |}_0^1 = 864/4 - 216/5 *1 ? At 1: 216 * 1^4 - wait.

864 * (1/4) = 216? 864/4=216

- 216 * (1/5) = -216/5? No.

∫ 864 t^3 dt = 864 * \frac{t^4}{4} = 216 t^4

At t=1, 216

∫ -216 t^4 dt = -216 * \frac{t^5}{5} = - \frac{216}{5} t^5

At t=1, -216/5

So total ∫ g dt from 0 to 1 = 216 - 216/5 = 216(1 - 1/5) = 216 * 4/5 = 864/5 = 172.8

Then times |r'| = sqrt(46) ≈6.7823

So 172.8 * 6.7823 ≈ let's compute: 170*6.7823=1152.991, 2.8*6.7823≈19.00044, total ≈1172.0

Now, earlier I thought average f around 300 or so, but 300 * length ≈6.782*300=2034.6, but I got 1172, which is less, but at t=0.5, f=94.5, which is much less than 648, and since it increases to 648, but starts at 0, so average might be around half of max or something, but max is 648, but it starts at 0, so average less than 324, say 200, 200*6.782≈1356.4, and 1172 is close, but earlier calculation shows at t=1 it's 648, but for the average of g(t), which is ∫ g dt / Δt = 172.8 / 1 = 172.8, and since g(t) increases from 0 to 648? At t=1, g(1)=216*1^3*(4-1)=216*3=648, yes, but g(t) is the function before ds, but in the integral for ∫ g dt, it's from 0 to 172.8, but over t from 0 to 1, so average is 172.8, but since ds = |r'| dt ≈6.782 dt, so for each dt, the ds is larger, but in terms of value, the average of f ds is ∫ f ds / s, but s is length ≈6.782, ∫ f ds ≈1172, so average ≈1172 / 6.782 ≈ 172.8, which matches the average of g(t) since ds proportional to dt.

g(t) ∫ is 172.8, |r'| is about 6.782, so average f ds is (∫ f ds) / (length) = 1172 / 6.782 ≈ 172.8, and since f ds = f |r'| dt, and |r'| constant, so average of f is avg of g(t)? ∫ f ds = ∫ g(t) |r'| dt, so avg f ds = (∫ f ds) / s = [ ∫ g(t) |r'| dt ] / [ |r'| dt over range ] but dt range is 1, s = |r'| * 1, so avg f ds = [ ∫ g(t) |r'| dt ] / ( |r'| * 1 ) = (1/|r'|) ∫ g(t) |r'| dt / (something), better.

Since ds = |r'| dt, and t from 0 to 1, length s = |r'| * (1-0) = sqrt(46)

∫ f ds = ∫ f |r'| dt = |r'| ∫ g(t) dt, where g(t)=f(t)

So avg f ds = (1/s) ∫ f ds = (1/|r'|) * |r'| ∫ g dt / 1? s = |r'| * Δt = |r'| *1

Avg f ds = [ ∫ f ds ] / s = [ |r'| ∫ g dt ] / [ |r'| * 1 ] = ∫ g dt / 1 = 172.8

So average of the differential form is 172.8, and since it's constant in t, but g(t) increases from 0 to 648, average is 172.8, which is plausible since it starts at 0 and ends at 648, average about 324 if linear, but since cubic, lower, 172.8 seems reasonable.

But anyway, my calculation seems consistent.

Now, back to expression: \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

I can simplify by factoring out common factors, but 864 and 46.

864 is even, 46 is even, but in sqrt, perhaps write as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

Notice that 864 = 864, but I can write 864 as 864, or reduce.

Another way: earlier when I had 216 * 4 / 5 * sqrt(46)

216 = 216, 4=4, but 216 and 4 and 5.

216 = 216, 4=4, so 216*4=864, same.

Notice that in the expression, I can write it as \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Since 216 and 4, but 216 = 216, I can write as \frac{216}{5} \times 4 \sqrt{46}, but same.

Perhaps factor out 8 or something, but no need.

Notice that 864 / 5 is already simplified, but I can write it as a boxed answer.

But in the fraction, it's fine.

Another thought: in the parametric equation, I assumed direction from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), and t from 0 to 1, which is correct.

When I compute x(t)=6t, at t=0,0; t=1,6.

y=6-3t, z=4-t.

f=x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t)

Then ∫_0^1 216 t^3 (4-t) \sqrt{46}  dt

I can factor out constants: 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt

As before.

∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = as computed, 4/5.

So 216 \sqrt{46} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, perhaps I can reduce 864 and 5, but as said, gcd is 1.

864 and 5: 5 is prime, 864 mod 5 = 864 /5 =172*5=860, remainder 4, not zero, so not divisible, so fraction is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Sometimes people write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, or combine.

Notice that 864 and 46, but 46 is under square root, so not helpful.

I could write sqrt(46) as is.

But perhaps leave it.

Another way: since |r'| = sqrt(46), and the path length is sqrt(46), but I think it's fine.

Perhaps compute numerically, but for exact answer.

Notice that in the parameterization, I can use a different parameter, but not necessary.

I could parameterize by arc length, but since constant speed, it's the same.

The total arc length is s = |r'| t, but since |r'| constant, ds = |r'| dt, so same.

Let s be arc length from start. s = |r'| t, so ds = |r'| dt, so dt = ds / |r'|, but since |r'| constant, same as before.

t = s / |r'|, but in terms of s, but f in terms of s might be messy.

For example, x = 6t = 6 s / sqrt(46)

Similarly, z = 4 - t = 4 - s / sqrt(46)

Then f = x^3 z = \left( \frac{6s}{\sqrt{46}} \right)^3 \left(4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} \right)

Then ∫ f ds from s=0 to s=|r'| = sqrt(46)

s from 0 to sqrt(46)

f = \left( \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} \right) ? Let's see.

\left( \frac{6s}{\sqrt{46}} \right)^3 = 216 s^3 / ( \sqrt{46} )^3 ? ( \sqrt{46} )^3 = (46)^{3/2} = 46 \sqrt{46}

Since ( \sqrt{46} )^2 = 46, so ( \sqrt{46} )^3 = 46^{3/2} = 46 \sqrt{46}

So x^3 = [6s / \sqrt{46}]^3 = 216 s^3 / (46 \sqrt{46}) ? No:

[6s / \sqrt{46} ]^3 = 6^3 s^3 / ( \sqrt{46} )^3 = 216 s^3 / (46^{3/2})

46^{3/2} = (46^1) * (46^{1/2}) = 46 \sqrt{46}

Yes.

Now z = 4 - s / \sqrt{46} = 4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}}

So f = x^3 z = [216 s^3 / (46 \sqrt{46}) ] * [4 - s / \sqrt{46} ]

Now, to write neatly, 216 / (46 \sqrt{46}) s^3 (4 - s / \sqrt{46})

But then multiply by ds, so integral is ∫_0^{\sqrt{46}} [216 s^3 / (46 \sqrt{46}) ] (4 - s / \sqrt{46}) ds

This looks messier because of the denominator.

Set u = s / \sqrt{46}, then s = u \sqrt{46}, ds = \sqrt{46} du

When s=0, u=0; s=\sqrt{46}, u=1

Then f ds = [216 (u \sqrt{46})^3 / (46 \sqrt{46}) ] * [4 - u \sqrt{46} / \sqrt{46} ] * \sqrt{46} du ? Let's see.

First, s^3 = (u \sqrt{46})^3 = u^3 * 46^{3/2} = u^3 * 46 \sqrt{46} ? ( \sqrt{46} )^3 = 46^{1.5} = 46 \sqrt{46}, yes.

In x^3, we have 216 s^3 / (46 \sqrt{46}) = 216 * (u^3 * 46 \sqrt{46}) / (46 \sqrt{46}) ? No.

From earlier, x^3 = 216 s^3 / (46 \sqrt{46})

s^3 = [u \sqrt{46}]^3 = u^3 * 46^{3/2} = u^3 * 46 \sqrt{46}

So x^3 = 216 * [u^3 * 46 \sqrt{46}] / (46 \sqrt{46}) = 216 u^3 * [46 \sqrt{46} / (46 \sqrt{46}) ] = 216 u^3

The denominator 46 \sqrt{46} and numerator 46 \sqrt{46}, so yes, x^3 = 216 u^3

Similarly, z = 4 - s / \sqrt{46} = 4 - (u \sqrt{46}) / \sqrt{46} = 4 - u

And ds = \sqrt{46} du

So f ds = x^3 z ds = (216 u^3) (4 - u) \sqrt{46} du

Same as before, since u is the same as t in my first parameterization.

So back to same expression.

So no simplification.

Thus, my expression is correct.

So integral is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

To write it neatly.

Notice that 864 / 5 = 172.8, but better as fraction.

864 and 5 have no common factors, so \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} or \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But in boxed answer, probably \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Since 864 = 864, I could factor out 8 or something, but no.

Another way: notice that in the original, f=x^3 z, and the vector, but I think it's fine.

So, the final answer is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me confirm the constant.

Earlier, 216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5, yes.

216 is 6^3, but it's fine.

Perhaps write as \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} but same.

So, I think this is the answer.

But in the problem, it's a line segment, and I think I covered it.

Perhaps the direction, but since from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), x increases, z decreases, but in the function x^3 z, when x=0, it's zero, so from start to end, it's fine.

So, I think correct.

So, the line integral is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

To box it.

But perhaps simplify by reducing fractions, but 864 and 5 coprime.

864 = 2^5 * 3^3, 5 prime, so no common factors.

46=2*23, no square factors, so sqrt(46) simplified.

So, \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but same.

So, for the boxed answer.

In some formats, they write it as a single fraction.

But I think it's acceptable.

So, I'll go with that.


==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), parameterize the curve using a parameter \(t\) that ranges from 0 to 1.

The parametric equations are:
- \(x(t) = 6t\)
- \(y(t) = 6 - 3t\)
- \(z(t) = 4 - t\)

The derivative of the position vector \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is \(\mathbf{r}'(t) = (6, -3, -1)\). The magnitude is:
\[
|\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}
\]
Since \(|\mathbf{r}'(t)|\) is constant, it simplifies the computation. The line integral with respect to arc length \(ds\) is given by:
\[
\int_C f(x, y, z)  ds = \int_0^1 f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) \cdot |\mathbf{r}'(t)|  dt
\]
where \(f(x, y, z) = x^3 z\). Substituting the parameterization:
\[
f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (6t)^3 \cdot (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t)
\]
Thus, the integrand becomes:
\[
216t^3 (4 - t) \cdot \sqrt{46}
\]
The integral is:
\[
\int_0^1 216t^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216(4t^3 - t^4)  dt
\]
Simplify the constant factor \(216\sqrt{46}\):
\[
216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt
\]
Compute the integral of \(4t^3 - t^4\):
\[
\int (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}
\]
Evaluate from 0 to 1:
\[
\left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left(1^4 - \frac{1^5}{5}\right) - (0) = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
Now substitute back:
\[
216\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}
\]
The fraction \(\frac{864}{5}\) is already simplified, as 864 and 5 are coprime. The term \(\sqrt{46}\) is simplified since 46 has no square factors other than 1.

Thus, the value of the line integral is \(\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}\).

\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
