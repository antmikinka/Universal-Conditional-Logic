**Processing numerical expressions**

I need to convert numbers into spoken language according to specific rules. For negative numbers, I'd use "negative ...", for decimals, I say "integer part point digits", and for fractions, it’s "a over b". When it comes to exponents, I'd say "to the power of." For something like x^3 z ds, I'd articulate it as "x to the power of three times z, d s." I also need to take care with how I vocalize coordinates in lists. 

For computing the integral, I’m working through parameters from r0=(0,6,4) to r1=(6,3,3). That gives a path defined as r(t), where t ranges from 0 to 1.**Calculating the integral**

I’m working on the integral, starting with the expression for the integrand: \(x^3 z ds = (6t)^3 \cdot (4 - t) \cdot \sqrt{46} dt\), which simplifies to \(216t^3(4 - t) \sqrt{46} dt\). Integrating gives me \( \sqrt{46} \cdot 216 \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt\). After evaluating it, I reach the numeric expression \((864/5) \sqrt{46}\), or \(172.8 \cdot \sqrt{46}\). But I should stick to fractions and say "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six."**Verbalizing the integral product**

I need to express the product as "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six." My processing framework indicates I should apply nesting depth to group the components. The final answer needs to be in TTS-ready sentences, so I might number those individual steps for clarity. Additionally, I have to ensure there are no mathematical symbols, and JSON must be valid. I'll also include details like the problem statement and ensure the answer format is marked as "tts_ready."**Constructing the JSON format**

I need to ensure that JSON string values are properly quoted and escaped without any unnecessary symbols, keeping everything concise. For my scratchwork steps, I’ll begin with parameterizing the line segment. I’ll phrase it as "function r of t equals vector six t, six minus three t, four minus t, with t from zero to one." For the TTS rules, I’ll present the vector components as separated values. 

Next, I'll compute the derivative, saying, "the derivative r prime of t equals vector six, negative three, negative one, and its magnitude is square root of forty-six.”**Preparing the JSON output**

For the scratchwork steps, I’ll start with "ds equals square root of forty-six times d t." Next, I’ll express the integrand as "the quantity six t to the power of three times the quantity four minus t times square root of forty-six d t." Then, I'll evaluate the integral: "multiply square root of forty-six by two hundred sixteen times the integral from zero to one of four t cubed minus t to the power of four d t."

Now, I'll compute the antiderivative, stating: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length over C, where C is the line segment from the point zero comma six comma four to the point six comma three comma three." Finally, I'll ensure my JSON is valid and formatted correctly according to all noted requirements.
