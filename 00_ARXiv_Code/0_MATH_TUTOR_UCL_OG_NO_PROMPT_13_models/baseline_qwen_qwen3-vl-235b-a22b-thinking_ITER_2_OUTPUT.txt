=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). 

First, I need to parameterize the line segment. To do that, I can find the direction vector by subtracting the initial point from the terminal point. So the direction vector is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). 

Now, I'll parameterize the line using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The parametric equations should be:
x = 0 + 6t = 6t,
y = 6 - 3t,
z = 4 - t.

Next, I need to find ds, which is the differential arc length. For a parameterization r(t) = <x(t), y(t), z(t)>, ds = ||r'(t)|| dt. So I need to compute the derivative of r(t).

r'(t) = <6, -3, -1>, so the magnitude is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). Therefore, ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x and z into the integrand. x³z becomes (6t)³(4 - t) = 216t³(4 - t) = 216(4t³ - t⁴).

The integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of 216(4t³ - t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt.

Let me factor out the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Compute the integral inside: ∫4t³ dt = t⁴, ∫t⁴ dt = t⁵/5. So evaluating from 0 to 1:

[4*(1⁴)/4 - (1⁵)/5] = [1 - 1/5] = 4/5. Wait, no: ∫(4t³ - t⁴) dt = t⁴ - (t⁵)/5. At 1, that's 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. At 0, it's 0. So the integral is 4/5.

Multiply by the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) * sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the calculation again. 216 * 4 = 864, so 864/5 is 172.8. So the final answer is (864√46)/5.

Let me verify the steps:

1. Parameterization: correct. From (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), direction vector (6, -3, -1), so parametric equations with t from 0 to 1.

2. Derivative of r(t) is (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36 +9 +1)=sqrt(46). Correct.

3. x³z: (6t)^3*(4 - t) = 216t³(4 - t). Correct.

4. The integral becomes 216*sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt. The integral of 4t³ is t^4, integral of t^4 is t^5/5. So at 1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

5. Multiply 216 * 4/5 = 864/5. So total is (864/5)√46.

Yes, that seems right. So the main answer should be 864 times square root of 46 divided by 5.

For the TTS conversion, the main answer is "eight hundred sixty-four divided by five times square root of forty-six".

Wait, but the problem says "tts_ready" format. So we need to phrase it correctly.

The value is (864√46)/5. In TTS terms, it's "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six".

Check scratchwork steps:

- Parameterize the line segment from (0, six, four) to (six, three, three) as x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, for t from zero to one.

- Compute ds as the magnitude of the derivative, which is square root of (six squared plus negative three squared plus negative one squared) equals square root of forty-six.

- Substitute x and z into the integrand: (six t) cubed times (four minus t) equals two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t).

- Integrate from t equals zero to one: two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times the integral of (four t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.

- The integral evaluates to (t to the fourth minus t to the fifth over five) from zero to one, which is (one minus one fifth) equals four fifths.

- Multiply: two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths, so the final result is eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six.

Yes, that's correct.
