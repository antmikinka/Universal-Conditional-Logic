Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I remember that for line integrals with respect to arc length, ds, we need to parameterize the curve C. 

So, the first step is to find a parameterization of the line segment. A line segment from point P to point Q can be parameterized as r(t) = P + t(Q - P), where t goes from 0 to 1. Let's do that. 

Point P is (0,6,4) and point Q is (6,3,3). So, Q - P is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Therefore, the parameterization r(t) should be (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), where t ∈ [0,1]. Let me check: when t=0, we get (0,6,4), which is correct, and when t=1, we get (6,3,3), which is also correct. Good.

Now, for the line integral, we need to express ds in terms of t. The formula for ds is ||r'(t)|| dt, where r'(t) is the derivative of the parameterization. So, let's compute r'(t). 

r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), so r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). Then, the magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So, ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Next, we need to express the integrand x³ z in terms of t. From the parameterization, x = 6t, z = 4 - t. So, x³ z = (6t)³ (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216(4t³ - t⁴).

Putting it all together, the line integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [216(4t³ - t⁴)] * sqrt(46) dt. Let's factor out the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) times the integral from 0 to 1 of (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Now, compute the integral of (4t³ - t⁴) dt from 0 to 1. The antiderivative of 4t³ is 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴, and the antiderivative of -t⁴ is -t⁵/5. So, the antiderivative is t⁴ - (t⁵)/5. Evaluated from 0 to 1, that's (1⁴ - 1⁵/5) - (0 - 0) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

So, the integral becomes 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) * sqrt(46) = 864/5 * sqrt(46).

Let me check if I did everything correctly. Let's verify the parameterization: yes, from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so x goes from 0 to 6, y from 6 to 3, z from 4 to 3. So, x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t, which is correct. Then r'(t) is (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46), correct. Then x³ z is (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t), correct. Then ds is sqrt(46) dt, so the integral is 216 sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt. The integral of 4t³ is t⁴, integral of t⁴ is t⁵/5, so from 0 to 1, it's (1 - 1/5) = 4/5. Then 216 * 4/5 = 864/5. So, 864/5 sqrt(46). That seems right. 

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the parameterization or the magnitude. The direction vector is (6, -3, -1), so squared components are 36, 9, 1, sum to 46, square root is correct. The integrand substitution is correct. The integral calculation is straightforward. Yep, looks good.


==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral  
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds,
$$  
where $ C $ is the line segment from $ (0,6,4) $ to $ (6,3,3) $, we proceed as follows:

---

### **Step 1: Parameterize the Curve**

We parameterize the line segment using a vector function $ \mathbf{r}(t) $ for $ t \in [0,1] $. The direction vector from $ (0,6,4) $ to $ (6,3,3) $ is:
$$
(6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4) = (6, -3, -1).
$$
So, the parameterization is:
$$
\mathbf{r}(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), \quad t \in [0,1].
$$

---

### **Step 2: Compute $ ds $**

The differential arc length $ ds $ is given by:
$$
ds = \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| \, dt.
$$
Differentiate $ \mathbf{r}(t) $:
$$
\mathbf{r}'(t) = (6, -3, -1).
$$
Compute its magnitude:
$$
\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}.
$$
Thus,
$$
ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt.
$$

---

### **Step 3: Express the Integrand in Terms of $ t $**

From the parameterization:
- $ x = 6t $
- $ z = 4 - t $

So,
$$
x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216(4t^3 - t^4).
$$

---

### **Step 4: Set Up the Integral**

Substitute into the line integral:
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_0^1 216(4t^3 - t^4) \cdot \sqrt{46} \, dt.
$$
Factor out constants:
$$
= 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt.
$$

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate the Integral**

Compute the definite integral:
$$
\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}.
$$

Now multiply:
$$
216 \sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}.
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}}
$$
