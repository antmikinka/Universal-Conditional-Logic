**Calculating integral values**

I’m calculating the expression: So = sqrt(46) * (864*(1/4) - 216*(1/5)). It simplifies to sqrt(46) * (216 - 43.2), which is sqrt(46) * 172.8. I need to compute it step-by-step. Then, I check sqrt(46) is approximately 6.78233, and when I multiply this by 172.8, I get around 1172.0. So, I think it's okay to include both the exact symbolic result and the approximate numeric value!**Formatting JSON for problem statement**

I need to create a JSON object containing specific fields. For the problem_number, since there's no number in the image, I might leave it blank or set it to "1." Then, the problem_statement should include the line integral: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x^3 z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)." For question_type, it could be "line_integral" or "scalar_line_integral." The math_content_check should be "yes," and I'll specify the main_answer type as "exact." Lastly, for TTS formatting, I must verbalize all numbers and ensure they're in the appropriate string format.**Creating TTS-ready JSON values**

I need to include the expression for main_answer.values in a TTS-ready format, like "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six." I’m considering if I need to include "the quantity" based on nesting depth, but it might not be necessary. I'll apply symbol_to_speech mapping and produce TTS phrases. I'll also create scratchwork_answer.values as a list of TTS strings that capture steps in natural spoken language. I must ensure the JSON syntax is valid and doesn't have any extraneous fields, while avoiding mathematical notation like "=", and transform the term "sqrt" into "square root of..." for clarity. Finally, I’ll add "answer_format": "tts_ready."**Preparing JSON structure**

I'm getting ready to create a JSON object with specific fields. For the problem_number, I’ll set it to "1." The problem_statement will read, "Evaluate the line integral of x^3 z ds along C, the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)." For question_type, it'll be "scalar_line_integral_ds," and math_content_check will be "yes." The main_answer.type will be "exact," and values will contain "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six." I’ll include scratchwork_answer.values as a list of TTS-ready strings, starting with: "Parametrize the line: r of t equals vector six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t for t from zero to one."**Drafting JSON while ensuring TTS compliance**

I need to prepare a JSON structure that fully verbalizes its content. For the problem_number, I’ll use "one" instead of "1." The problem_statement will say, "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed z ds along C, the line segment from the point zero, six, four to the point six, three, three." For the question_type, I'll set it as "line_integral" and math_content_check as "yes." I’ll ensure that the scratchwork steps are all in TTS-ready format, avoiding any symbols or numeric representations, while using clear and concise language throughout the JSON object to maintain consistency and clarity.
