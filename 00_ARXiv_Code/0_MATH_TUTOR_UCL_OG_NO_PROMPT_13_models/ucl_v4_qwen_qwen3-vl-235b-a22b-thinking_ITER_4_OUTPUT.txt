=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The question is to evaluate the integral of x cubed times z ds over the line segment C from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I need to remember how to compute a line integral with respect to arc length. The formula is the integral over C of f(x,y,z) ds, which can be converted to a parameter integral. Since it's a line segment, I should parametrize the curve.

To parametrize the line segment from point A (0,6,4) to point B (6,3,3), I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general parametric equations for a line segment are:

x(t) = x_A + t(x_B - x_A)
y(t) = y_A + t(y_B - y_A)
z(t) = z_A + t(z_B - z_A)

Calculating the differences: x_B - x_A = 6 - 0 = 6, y_B - y_A = 3 -6 = -3, z_B - z_A = 3 -4 = -1. So the parametric equations become:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t
y(t) = 6 - 3t
z(t) = 4 - t

Now, I need to find ds, which is the differential arc length. For a parametric curve, ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt.

Compute the derivatives:

dx/dt = 6
dy/dt = -3
dz/dt = -1

Then, the magnitude of the derivative vector is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 +9 +1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Next, express the integrand x³ z in terms of t. Substitute x(t) and z(t):

x³ z = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216*(4t³ - t^4)

So the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [216*(4t³ - t^4)] * sqrt(46) dt.

Factor out the constants: 216*sqrt(46) times integral from 0 to1 of (4t³ - t^4) dt.

Compute the integral:

Integral of 4t³ dt is t^4, and integral of t^4 dt is (t^5)/5. So evaluating from 0 to1:

[ t^4 - (t^5)/5 ] from 0 to1 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5.

So the entire expression is 216*sqrt(46)*(4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the calculation again. The integral of 4t³ is 4*(t^4/4) = t^4. The integral of -t^4 is - (t^5)/5. So yes, from 0 to1 it's (1^4 - 1^5/5) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

Multiply by 216*sqrt(46): 216*(4/5) = 864/5. So the answer is (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, but let me check if I did the parametrization correctly. The line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). So when t=0, it's (0,6,4), t=1 it's (6,3,3). Correct. The derivatives are correct. The ds is sqrt(6² + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46). Correct.

The integrand substitution: x(t)=6t, so x^3 is (6t)^3=216 t^3. z(t)=4 - t. So yes, 216 t^3 (4 - t). Correct.

Integral of 4t^3 - t^4 from 0 to1 is [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

Multiply all together: 216 * 4/5 * sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46). So the final answer is 864/5 times the square root of 46.

I think that's right. Let me just verify if there's any step I missed. The line integral with respect to arc length is correctly parametrized. The substitution seems correct. The integration steps are straightforward. Yeah, I think that's correct.
