Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to remember how to compute a line integral of a scalar function over a curve. The formula for a line integral ∫_C f(x,y,z) ds is to parameterize the curve C, then express x, y, z in terms of the parameter, find ds in terms of the parameter, and then integrate over the parameter's range.

First, let's parameterize the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). The parameterization of a line segment from point A to point B is usually r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t goes from 0 to 1. Let's compute B - A: (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization is:

r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t ∈ [0,1].

Now, we need to find ds. The formula for ds is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, times dt. So first, compute r'(t):

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). Then the magnitude of r'(t) is √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46. So ds = √46 dt.

Next, express the integrand x³z in terms of t. From the parameterization, x = 6t, z = 4 - t. So x³z = (6t)³(4 - t) = 216t³(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴.

Now, the line integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * √46 dt. We can factor out √46:

√46 ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt.

Let's compute the integral inside. The integral of 864t³ is 864*(t⁴/4) = 216t⁴. The integral of -216t⁴ is -216*(t⁵/5) = -216t⁵/5. Evaluate from 0 to 1:

At t=1: 216(1)⁴ - 216(1)⁵/5 = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5.

At t=0: 0 - 0 = 0. So the integral inside is 864/5.

Then multiply by √46: (864/5)√46. Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure.

Wait, 6t cubed is 216t³, times (4 - t) is 216t³*4 - 216t³*t = 864t³ - 216t⁴. That's correct. Then the integral of 864t³ from 0 to 1 is 864*(1/4) = 216. Integral of -216t⁴ is -216*(1/5) = -216/5. So 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Correct. Then multiply by √46: 864√46 / 5. Let me check if that's the simplest form. 864 and 5 have no common factors, so yes.

Wait, let me verify the parameterization again. The line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). So when t=0, we get (0,6,4), which is correct. When t=1, we get (6,3,3), which is correct. The derivative is (6,-3,-1), magnitude √(36+9+1)=√46, correct. So ds=√46 dt, correct. Then the integrand substitution is correct. The integral calculation seems right. So the final answer should be 864√46 / 5.
