**Factoring and computing**

I’m thinking about factoring 864, and I'm pretty sure it breaks down to 2^5 * 3^3, which equals 32 * 27. That seems right. Now, I want to calculate 864/5 times the square root of 46. First, I'll check that the sign is positive — it is! I need to add the steps, include parameters, and compute the result clearly. Then I’ll focus on crafting a crisp final message to present everything neatly.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
Parametrize the line: r(t) = (0,6,4) + t(6,-3,-1) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Then r'(t) = (6,-3,-1) and |r'(t)| = sqrt(36+9+1) = sqrt(46).

The integrand along C is x^3 z = (6t)^3(4-t) = 216 t^3(4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4. Hence
∫_C x^3 z ds = ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46) dt
= sqrt(46) [864·(1/4) - 216·(1/5)]
= sqrt(46) (216 - 216/5)
= (864/5) sqrt(46).

Answer: (864/5) sqrt(46).
