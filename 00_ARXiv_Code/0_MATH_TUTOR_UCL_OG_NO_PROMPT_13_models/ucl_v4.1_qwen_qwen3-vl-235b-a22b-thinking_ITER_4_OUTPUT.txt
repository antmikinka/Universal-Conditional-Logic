=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). 

First, I need to parameterize the curve C. Since it's a line segment, I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for a line segment between two points (x0, y0, z0) and (x1, y1, z1) is r(t) = (x0 + t(x1 - x0), y0 + t(y1 - y0), z0 + t(z1 - z0)).

So plugging in the points, x goes from 0 to 6, so x(t) = 0 + t(6 - 0) = 6t. Similarly, y(t) = 6 + t(3 - 6) = 6 - 3t. z(t) = 4 + t(3 - 4) = 4 - t. So the parameterization is r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds. The differential arc length ds is |r'(t)| dt. Let's compute the derivative of r(t). r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x, z, and ds into the integral. The integrand is x³ z ds. So x³ is (6t)³ = 216 t³, z is (4 - t), and ds is sqrt(46) dt. So the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of 216 t³ (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt.

Let's factor out the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ t³ (4 - t) dt. Now expand the integrand: 4t³ - t⁴. So the integral becomes 216 sqrt(46) [ ∫₀¹ 4t³ dt - ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt ].

Compute each integral separately. ∫4t³ dt from 0 to1 is 4*(t⁴/4) from 0 to1 = [t⁴] from 0 to1 = 1 - 0 =1. ∫t⁴ dt from 0 to1 is [t⁵/5] from 0 to1 = 1/5 -0 = 1/5. So the difference is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

Multiply by the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46). Let me check the arithmetic. 216 *4 is 864, so 864/5 is 172.8, but we'll keep it as a fraction. So the final answer should be (864/5) times the square root of 46.

Wait, let me double-check the parameterization. The direction from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so the differences are 6, -3, -1, which is correct. The derivative is correct, magnitude sqrt(46). The substitution of x and z is correct. The integrand becomes 216 t³ (4 - t) sqrt(46). Integrating 4t³ - t^4 from 0 to1 gives 4*(1/4) - 1/5 = 1 - 1/5 =4/5. So 216 *4/5 = 864/5. So yes, the answer is (864/5) sqrt(46).
