**Evaluating the Integral Now**

I'm currently focused on the prompt. The core is a line integral problem. Specifically, it's asking me to evaluate $\int_C x^3z \, ds$ over a line segment. The initial parameters are clear: a function to integrate and the curve C, from (0,6,4) to (6,3,0). My next step is to define the parametric equation of the curve to proceed.


**Parametrizing the Curve**

I've successfully parameterized the line segment. I defined the vector $\mathbf{v}$ and created the parametric equations: $x(t) = 6t$, $y(t) = 6 - 3t$, and $z(t) = 4 - t$. I've also established the parameter range, $0 \le t \le 1$. Now, I'm shifting to calculating the differential arc length, $ds$.


**Finalizing the Calculation**

I'm presently integrating the expression. I successfully parameterized, found *ds*, and substituted into the integrand. The integral simplifies to $216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt$.  I have evaluated this to $216\sqrt{46} \times \frac{4}{5}$. I need to simplify and write the final answer.


**Refining the Solution**

I've meticulously reviewed my calculations. Everything checks out! The final answer is $\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$. There's no further simplification possible. I am satisfied with the result and confident in its accuracy.


**Calculating the Solution.**

I'm now writing out the complete solution, meticulously following my established plan. The parameterization, arc length calculation, and integrand substitution are all checked and ready to be presented in a clean and easy-to-follow manner. I'll make sure to clearly define each step, and explain the thought process for a complete understanding of the solution.


**Constructing the Output**

I'm presently arranging the solution. I've broken it down into clear steps: parametrization, finding *ds*, substituting, and integrating. I'm writing it in a format to ensure clarity, adding explanations where appropriate. The final expression is derived as $\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral $\int_C x^3 z \, ds$, where $C$ is the line segment from $(0, 6, 4)$ to $(6, 3, 3)$, we follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Parametrize the line segment $C$**

We can represent the line segment connecting two points $P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and $P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ using a parameter $t$ where $0 \le t \le 1$.

Given:
*   Start point $P_0 = (0, 6, 4)$
*   End point $P_1 = (6, 3, 3)$

First, find the direction vector $\mathbf{v}$ from $P_0$ to $P_1$:
$$\mathbf{v} = \langle 6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4 \rangle = \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle$$

Now, we can write the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$:
$$x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t$$
$$y(t) = 6 - 3t$$
$$z(t) = 4 - 1t = 4 - t$$
for $0 \le t \le 1$.

### **Step 2: Calculate the differential arc length $ds$**

The formula for the differential arc length $ds$ for a parametric curve is given by:
$$ds = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt$$

Compute the derivatives with respect to $t$:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = 6, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = -3, \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = -1$$

Now substitute these into the distance formula:
$$ds = \sqrt{(6)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} \, dt$$
$$ds = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} \, dt$$
$$ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt$$

### **Step 3: Substitute into the integral**

Substitute $x(t)$, $z(t)$, and $ds$ into the integral expression $\int x^3 z \, ds$:

$$\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_{0}^{1} (6t)^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46} \, dt$$

Simplify the integrand:
$$(6t)^3 = 216t^3$$
So, the integral becomes:
$$= \int_{0}^{1} 216t^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46} \, dt$$

Factor out the constant terms $216$ and $\sqrt{46}$:
$$= 216\sqrt{46} \int_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt$$

### **Step 4: Evaluate the integral**

Calculate the definite integral:
$$\int_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_{0}^{1}$$

Evaluate at the bounds:
At $t = 1$:   $(1)^4 - \frac{(1)^5}{5} = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}$
At $t = 0$:   $0 - 0 = 0$

So the value of the integral part is $\frac{4}{5}$.

Now, multiply by the constant factors:
$$= 216\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5}$$
$$= \frac{216 \cdot 4 \cdot \sqrt{46}}{5}$$
$$= \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$$

### **Final Answer:**
$$\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$$
