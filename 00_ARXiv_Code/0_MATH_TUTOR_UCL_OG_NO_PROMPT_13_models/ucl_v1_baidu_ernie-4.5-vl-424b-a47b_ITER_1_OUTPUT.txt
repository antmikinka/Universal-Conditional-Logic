=== REASONING / THINKING ===

We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 We need to parameterize the curve C.
 Let t be a parameter that goes from 0 to 1.
 Then the parameterization can be:
   x(t) = 0 + (6-0)t = 6t
   y(t) = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t
   z(t) = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

 The derivative with respect to t:
   dx/dt = 6
   dy/dt = -3
   dz/dt = -1

 The differential arc length ds is given by:
   ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt
      = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) dt
      = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) dt
      = sqrt(46) dt

 The integral becomes:
   ∫_{t=0}^{1} [x(t)]^3 * z(t) * sqrt(46) dt
   = ∫_{0}^{1} (6t)^3 * (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt
   = sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} 216 t^3 (4 - t) dt
   = 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) dt

 Now, compute the integral:
   ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1 = (1^4 - (1/5)*1^5) - 0 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

 Therefore, the integral is:
   216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) * sqrt(46) = (864 / 5) * sqrt(46) = 172.8 * sqrt(46)

 Alternatively, we can write as an exact fraction:
   864/5 * sqrt(46) = (864 sqrt(46)) / 5

 However, we can simplify the fraction? 864 and 5 are coprime, so we leave it.

 But note: 864/5 is 172.8, but we can also leave as fraction.

 Alternatively, we can factor the integral step:

   = 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) 
   = (216 * 4 * sqrt(46)) / 5
   = 864 sqrt(46) / 5

 So the final answer is 864 sqrt(46) / 5.

 However, let me check the calculation of the integral again:

   ∫_0^1 4t^3 - t^4 dt = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

 But note: the parameterization and the expression for the integrand is correct.

 Alternatively, we can write the answer in decimal if needed, but the problem doesn't specify. However, the instruction says to output in TTS compatible natural spoken language and then as a JSON. But the main answer is the value.

 However, note that the output specification requires a JSON with the main answer in a list and scratchwork if needed.

 But the user's request is just to evaluate the integral. We'll output the answer in the required format.

 Steps for TTS transformation (as per the system role) will convert the mathematical expression to spoken form. However, the system role says to output in JSON. So we will structure the JSON as per the template.

 But note: the condition "math_content_check" is "yes", so we activate mathematical processing.

 We are to output in JSON with:
   problem_number: (we don't have a problem number in the input, so we can omit or set to null? But the template expects it. The input doesn't have a problem number, so we can set to "1" or "unknown". Alternatively, we can extract from the input? The input doesn't have a number. Let's set to "1".)

   problem_statement: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

   question_type: we need to classify. This is a line integral, so we can set to "line_integral". Alternatively, the system might not have a specific case for that, so we can set to "calculus". But the template has cases like multiple choice, fill in blanks, etc. This is an open response, so we can set to "open_response". However, the template doesn't have a case for that. Alternatively, we can set to "calculation". But the template has a default that applies minimal tracking. So we'll set to "calculation".

   math_content_check: "yes"

   final_answers: main_answer with type "expression" and value the answer we computed.

 Approach for main_answer:
   We have computed: 864 sqrt(46) / 5.

   We can write it as a string: "864√46/5" or in a TTS compatible way? The system role says to convert mathematical expressions to natural spoken language, but the output is in JSON and we are to put the TTS_ready string in the values.

   We have two formats: one for the main answer and one for scratchwork. We'll put the scratchwork as well.

   For the main_answer: the type is "expression", and the value is the string representing the expression. But the template says "tts_ready". However, the system role instructions for TTS transformation rules are applied during processing? But we are to output the values as TTS_ready.

   How to represent in TTS_ready? We can write it as a natural language expression? The system has rules for that. But note the template expects the values to be an array of TTS_ready strings. However, we have one answer. We can represent it as a string in a TTS-ready format.

   Alternatively, we can output the exact expression in a string that the TTS can read. But the TTS transformation rules are already part of the system. However, we are to output the JSON. So we'll write the expression in a way that is natural: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five". But that is verbose.

   Alternatively, we can output in a simplified symbolic form? But the requirement says "TTS compatible natural spoken language". However, the system's transformation rules are for individual expressions. We are to break down? But the answer is a single expression.

   Since the system role has a rule for "\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}", we can use the transformation rule for fractions and square roots? But the transformation rules are applied during the processing, and we are to output the TTS_ready string. However, in the JSON, we are to write the string in TTS_ready form.

   We can use the rules:
      fraction: "numerator over denominator" -> so 864 over 5, but then multiplied by sqrt(46). We can say "864 times square root of 46 over 5"? That is acceptable.

   But note: the transformation rule for fraction: "{{numerator}} over {{denominator}}", and for exponent and square root. We are not having an exponent here, just fraction and square root.

   Alternatively, we can use: "The quantity 864 times the square root of 46 divided by 5". But we can also note that 864/5 is a fraction. We can break it as:

        (864 / 5) * sqrt(46) -> "eight hundred sixty-four divided by five, multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

   However, to avoid confusion, we can write: "fraction with numerator 864 times the square root of 46 and denominator 5", but that is not very natural.

   Alternatively, we can use: "864 square root of 46 divided by 5". But that is ambiguous.

   The best way is to write: "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six over five".

   However, the system has a rule for negative numbers, decimals, fractions, exponents, and square roots. But we are not forced to break every symbol? We are to preserve mathematical accuracy. So we can write the expression as a string that is meant to be read by TTS: "864 * sqrt(46) / 5" is not spoken. We have to use words.

   The system's TTS transformation rules are applied during the processing, but we are the Math TTS processor. We should output the TTS_ready string. However, the system also has a rule for function notation: "function ... of ...", but we don't have a function here.

   We can design the TTS_ready string as: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five".

   Alternatively, we can write it as: "eight hundred sixty-four over five, multiplied by the square root of forty-six".

   Both are acceptable.

   However, note that the entire expression is a constant, so we can also say: "the fraction 864 times the square root of 46 divided by 5". But we want natural language.

   I think the first version is natural.

   But note: the system role says "preserving mathematical accuracy". So we want to be clear. We can also write: "the product of 864, the square root of 46, and the reciprocal of 5". That is more precise but less natural.

   Let's go with: "864 times the square root of 46 divided by 5"

   However, to avoid ambiguity, we can use: "eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six, then divided by five"

   But the system has a rule for explicit comma statement for list? We are not in a list. So we can write without commas: "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six over five"

   However, to be safe and natural, we can write: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

   For the scratchwork, we have the steps. We'll break down the scratchwork into steps and convert each step to TTS_ready.

   Steps in scratchwork:

     1. Parameterize the curve: from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) as (x(t),y(t),z(t)) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t) for t in [0,1].
     2. Compute derivatives: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1.
     3. Compute ds: sqrt(6^2+(-3)^2+(-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46).
     4. The integrand: x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t).
     5. The integral becomes: ∫_{0}^{1} 216 t^3 (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt = 216 sqrt(46) ∫_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) dt.
     6. Compute ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.
     7. Then 216 sqrt(46) * 4/5 = 864 sqrt(46) / 5.

   We need to convert each step to TTS_ready. But the scratchwork answer values should be an array of TTS_ready strings.

   We'll write the steps concisely and in natural language.

   Example step 1: "Parameterize the curve: starting point (0,6,4) to ending point (6,3,3) with t from 0 to 1, yielding x(t)=6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t."

   But we need to be mindful of the TTS compatibility. We'll break down the equations.

   Alternatively, we can write in a list of steps:

   Step 1: "We parameterize the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) by t in [0,1] as: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t."
   Step 2: "The derivatives are: dx/dt equals 6, dy/dt equals negative 3, dz/dt equals negative 1."
   Step 3: "The differential arc length ds equals the square root of (6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared) equals the square root of 46 dt."
   Step 4: "The integrand x cubed z becomes (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) equals 216 t cubed times (4 minus t)."
   Step 5: "The integral becomes 216 times the square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of (4t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt."
   Step 6: "The integral of 4t cubed minus t to the fourth from 0 to 1 is [t to the fourth minus (1/5)t to the fifth] from 0 to 1 equals 1 minus 1/5 equals 4/5."
   Step 7: "Thus, the integral is 216 times the square root of 46 times 4/5 equals 864 times the square root of 46 divided by 5."

   We can write each step as a string.

   However, note that the scratchwork is optional? The template requires it only if we have multiple blanks? But in this case, we have no blanks. But the template says "scratchwork_answer" is required? Actually, the template has it as:

        "scratchwork_answer": {
            "values": [ ... list of TTS_ready strings ... ],
            "answer_format": "tts_ready"
        }

   We will include it.

   Now, the JSON structure.

   We'll build:

   {
        "problem_number": "1",
        "problem_statement": "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).",
        "question_type": "line_integral",   // or we can set to "calculation", but let's set to "line_integral" if we have a case? The template doesn't have a case for line integral. So we can set to "calculation". Alternatively, the default minimal tracking. But we can set to "calculation".
        "math_content_check": "yes",
        "final_answers": {
            "main_answer": {
                "type": "expression",
                "values": ["eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"],
                "answer_format": "tts_ready"
            },
            "scratchwork_answer": {
                "values": [
                    "Parameterize the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) by t in [0,1] as: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t.",
                    "The derivatives are: dx/dt equals 6, dy/dt equals negative 3, dz/dt equals negative 1.",
                    "The differential arc length ds equals the square root of (6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared) equals the square root of 46 dt.",
                    "The integrand x cubed z becomes (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) equals 216 t cubed times (4 minus t).",
                    "The integral becomes 216 times the square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of (4t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.",
                    "The integral of 4t cubed minus t to the fourth from 0 to 1 is [t to the fourth minus (1/5)t to the fifth] from 0 to 1 equals 1 minus 1/5 equals 4/5.",
                    "Thus, the integral is 216 times the square root of 46 times 4/5 equals 864 times the square root of 46 divided by 5."
                ],
                "answer_format": "tts_ready"
            }
        }
   }

 But note: the problem_number was not given. We can set to "unknown", but the template expects a string. We can leave as empty string? But the template doesn't specify. Alternatively, we can omit it? But the template includes it. We can set to null? However, the template has it as text. We'll set to "1" as an example.

 Alternatively, we can extract from the problem? The problem has no number. So we set to "1".

 However, the system might be processing multiple problems? We are only given one.

 We'll output the above JSON.

 But note: the quality control requires:
   - tts_compatibility: 100%
   - mathematical_accuracy: 95% or above -> we are 100% sure of the calculation? We are confident.
   - json_syntax: 100% -> valid JSON.
   - zero_symbols: true -> we have converted every symbol to words.

 However, the scratchwork has mathematical expressions? But we have converted the expressions in the steps to words. We broke down each expression.

 For example, "x cubed" for x^3, "t to the fourth" for t^4, etc.

 So we have preserved the mathematical accuracy by breaking down the expressions.

 Therefore, we output the JSON.

 But note: the system might have an optimization engine that if the response size is over 2000 characters, we compress. Our scratchwork steps are about 1000 characters? We'll output as is.

 Let's write the JSON.
