**Formatting JSON for math problem**

I'm working on formatting a JSON object for a math problem. I need to ensure it follows the specified template, starting with the problem number and statement. The math content check is marked as "yes," and the answer format requires text-to-speech readiness.

I also have to choose “exact” for the answer and include a scratchwork array with detailed steps. It seems I must avoid using any mathematical symbols and format coordinates properly. Alright, let's put this together!**Evaluating line integral**

I'm working on a problem where I need to evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z, with respect to arc length along curve C. C is defined as a line segment between two points.

For the scratchwork, I'll start by parameterizing C. I'll write it as "r of t equals" followed by the coordinates with proper function notation. It’s important I transform this notation correctly, while keeping everything clear and natural. Alright, let’s organize these steps!**Continuing line integral evaluation**

I’m breaking down the next steps in evaluating the line integral. First, I’ll establish that x equals six times t, and z equals four minus t. Then, I need to compute the derivative r prime of t, which gives me the vector components six, negative three, and negative one.

Next, I’ll calculate the norm of r prime, which involves taking the square root of forty-six. For the integrand, I see I need to vocalize the coefficients and operations to make them clear: I'll express this as "eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the power of four." Finally, I should also mention the multiplication by the norm in the next steps.**Finalizing the line integral calculation**

Now I’m at the point where I need to express the line integral: it equals the integral from zero to one of the expression "eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the power of four," multiplied by the square root of forty-six, all integrated with respect to t.

For the integration, I’ll compute it symbolically, avoiding decimals. I find that integrating gives me "two hundred sixteen t to the power of four minus two hundred sixteen over five t to the power of five." Keeping it in fraction form seems clearer here, even though I know two hundred sixteen over five equals forty-three point two.**Wrapping up the line integral calculation**

Now I'm finalizing the evaluation: it equals the square root of forty-six times the quantity of "two hundred sixteen t to the power of four minus two hundred sixteen over five t to the power of five," evaluated from zero to one.

After plugging in the limits, I simplify two hundred sixteen minus two hundred sixteen over five, which gives me eight hundred sixty-four over five. The final answer then becomes "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six." I’ll make sure everything is consistent and check for grammatical accuracy before crafting the JSON output.
