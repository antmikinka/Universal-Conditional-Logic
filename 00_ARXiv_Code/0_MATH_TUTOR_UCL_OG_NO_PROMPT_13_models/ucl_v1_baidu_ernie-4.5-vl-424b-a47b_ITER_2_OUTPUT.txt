We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 Since it's a line integral with respect to arc length (ds), we can parameterize the curve and then compute.

 Step 1: Parameterize the line segment.
 Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
 Let r(0) = (0,6,4) and r(1) = (6,3,3).
 Then, the parametric equations are:
   x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t
   y(t) = 6 - 3t
   z(t) = 4 - t

 Step 2: Compute the derivatives with respect to t.
   x'(t) = 6
   y'(t) = -3
   z'(t) = -1

 Step 3: Compute the magnitude of the derivative vector (the speed).
   ||r'(t)|| = sqrt( (6)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

 Step 4: Express the integral in terms of t.
   The integral becomes:
       ∫_{t=0}^{1} [ (x(t))^3 * z(t) ] * ||r'(t)|| dt
   = ∫_{0}^{1} [ (6t)^3 * (4-t) ] * sqrt(46) dt
   = ∫_{0}^{1} (216 t^3) * (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt
   = 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} t^3 (4-t) dt

 Step 5: Expand the integrand and integrate.
   t^3 (4-t) = 4t^3 - t^4

   So, ∫_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [ t^4 - (1/5)t^5 ] from 0 to 1? 
   Actually: 
        ∫4t^3 dt = 4*(t^4/4) = t^4
        ∫t^4 dt = t^5/5
   So the integral becomes: [ t^4 - (1/5)t^5 ] from 0 to 1 = (1^4 - (1/5)*1^5) - 0 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

   Alternatively: 
        ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [ t^4 - (1/5)t^5 ]? Let's check derivative: 
        d/dt [t^4] = 4t^3, so actually it should be: 
        ∫4t^3 dt = t^4, ∫t^4 dt = t^5/5, so the antiderivative is t^4 - (t^5)/5.

   Then at 1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

 Step 6: Multiply by the constant factor.
   Result = 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5)

   = (216 * 4 / 5) * sqrt(46)
   = (864 / 5) * sqrt(46)

   = 172.8 * sqrt(46)

   However, we can leave it as a fraction: 864/5 * sqrt(46)

   But let's simplify the fraction: 864 and 5 have no common factors.

 Alternatively, we can write it as: (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5

 Step 7: We can compute the numerical value if needed, but the problem doesn't specify. 
   However, since it's a math problem, we can leave it in exact form.

   But note: 864 and 5: 864/5 is 172.8, but we might leave as fraction.

   Alternatively, we can factor out common factors? But 864 and 5 are coprime.

   So the exact answer is (864/5) * sqrt(46). We can write it as (864 sqrt(46))/5.

   However, we can simplify 864 and 5? No, so that's the simplified fraction.

   But wait, let me check the integral calculation again:

        ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [ t^4 - (t^5)/5 ]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.  That's correct.

   And the constant factor: 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (216*4)/5 * sqrt(46) = 864/5 * sqrt(46)

   We can also write it as a mixed number? But in math, we often leave it as an improper fraction.

   Alternatively, we can factor 864: but it's already simplified.

   However, note that 864 = 16 * 54 = 16 * 9 * 6, but that doesn't help.

   Therefore, the answer is (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

   But let me compute the numerical value to check:

        sqrt(46) ≈ 6.782329983
        864 * 6.782329983 ≈ 5860.33 (approximately)
        then divided by 5: 5860.33 / 5 ≈ 1172.066

   However, we are to output in exact form.

   Alternatively, we can write it as a simplified expression. But note that 864 and 5 are coprime, so we cannot simplify the fraction.

   So the exact value is: (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 However, let me check the parameterization and the integral setup again.

 Another way: We can compute the integral without factoring out the constant? We already did.

 But note: the integral expression is 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = 216 * 4 * sqrt(46) / 5 = 864 sqrt(46) / 5.

 So the final answer is $\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$.

 But wait, let me see if we can simplify 864? It's 864, which is 16*54? Actually, 864 = 16 * 54? 16*54=864? 16*50=800, 16*4=64 -> 864, yes. But 54 is 9*6, so we can write:

        864 = 16 * 54 = 16 * 9 * 6 = 144 * 6? Actually, 144*6=864? 144*6: 100*6=600, 44*6=264 -> 864, yes. But that doesn't simplify the fraction.

 Alternatively, we can leave it as is.

 Alternatively, we can factor out 16 and then square root? But note: 16 is a square, so sqrt(16)=4, but 16 is in the numerator? Then:

        864 sqrt(46) / 5 = 16 * 54 * sqrt(46) / 5 = 16 * sqrt(46) * 54 / 5.

 But 54 and 5 are coprime, so we can't simplify.

 Alternatively, we can write sqrt(46) as sqrt(2*23) and that's already simplified.

 So we'll output: $\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$.

 However, note that 864/5 is 172.8, so we could write 172.8 sqrt(46), but exact form is better.

 Alternatively, we can factor 864 to see if there is a square factor: 864 = 54 * 16 = 16 * 54, and 16 is a square, but 54 is not a square. So:

        864 sqrt(46) / 5 = 16 * 54 * sqrt(46) / 5 = 16 * sqrt(54^2 * 46) / 5? No, that's not helpful.

   Actually, we can write: 864 sqrt(46) = 16 * 54 * sqrt(46) = 16 * sqrt(54^2 * 46)? Not linearly.

   Alternatively, 864 = 144 * 6, so:

        864 sqrt(46) / 5 = 144 * 6 * sqrt(46) / 5 = 144 * sqrt(36 * 46) / 5? But 36*46=1656, which is not a perfect square.

   So we leave it as (864 sqrt(46))/5.

 But note: we can factor out the 4 from the original expansion? Actually, we did.

 Alternatively, we can compute the integral by distributing:

        ∫ 216 t^3 * (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt from 0 to 1
        = 216 sqrt(46) ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1
        = 216 sqrt(46) [ t^4 - t^5/5 ]_0^1
        = 216 sqrt(46) (1 - 1/5) = 216 sqrt(46) * (4/5) = 864 sqrt(46)/5.

 So it's correct.

 Now, the problem says "Evaluate the line integral", so we output the exact value.

 However, note that the problem might expect a simplified form. But 864/5 is 172.8, and then multiplied by sqrt(46). But 172.8 is 864/5, so we can write it as a fraction times a square root.

 Alternatively, we can write: $\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}$.

 But to write in the boxed answer, we use LaTeX: \dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5} or \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}.

 However, let me reduce 864 and 5: gcd(864,5)=1, so it's already in simplest form.

 So the final answer is $\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$.

 But wait, I just thought: 864 is even, 5 is prime, so yes.

 Alternatively, we can factor 864 = 144 * 6, and 144 is a square. So:

        864 sqrt(46) / 5 = (144 * 6 * sqrt(46)) / 5 = 144 * sqrt(36 * 46) / 5? Not exactly.

        Actually, we can write: 6 * sqrt(46) = sqrt(36 * 46) = sqrt(1656). But 1656 is not a perfect square? 
        1656: 1656/4=414, 414=9*46? 46 is prime? 46=2*23, so 1656=4*9*2*23= 36*2*23? So sqrt(1656)=sqrt(36*46)=6 sqrt(46). So that doesn't help.

        Alternatively, 864 = 144 * 6, so we can write:

            (144 * 6 * sqrt(46)) / 5 = 144 * sqrt(36 * 46) / 5? No, because 6 * sqrt(46) is already the same as sqrt(36*46)=sqrt(1656). But then:

            = 144 * sqrt(1656) / 5? But 1656 is not simplified? Actually, 1656 = 4*414 = 4*2*207=8*207=8*9*23=72*23. So sqrt(1656)=sqrt(4*414)=2 sqrt(414). And 414=9*46? 46*9=414, yes. So:

            = 144 * 2 * sqrt(414) / 5? That's 288 sqrt(414)/5, but that's more complicated.

        So we stick to 864 sqrt(46)/5.

 Therefore, the answer is \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}.

 But note: the problem is from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). We parameterized linearly and computed. 

 Let me verify the magnitude of r'(t): 
        r'(t) = (6, -3, -1) -> ||r'(t)|| = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46) -> correct.

 And the function: x(t)=6t, so x^3 = 216 t^3, z(t)=4-t, so (x^3)z = 216 t^3 (4-t) -> correct.

 Then integrated over t from 0 to 1: correct.

 So we are confident.

 Output the answer in the required JSON format? But the problem says "output the final answer within \boxed{}".

 However, the instruction says: "output the final answer within \boxed{}".

 But note: the problem is a line integral, and we are to output the answer.

 Since this is a text-based response and the problem is mathematical, we output the LaTeX of the boxed answer.

 But the system also provides a JSON specification? However, the user's request is to evaluate the line integral.

 Since the system is set to output in JSON, but the user's request is for the answer, and we are to box the answer.

 How to reconcile? The instruction says: "output the final answer within \boxed{}".

 So we output:

 \boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}

 But note: the problem might expect a simplified radical? However, 46 has no square factors, so this is simplified.

 Alternatively, we can write it as \boxed{\frac{864}{5}\sqrt{46}} which is equivalent.

 So we choose that.

 However, the problem says "Picture 1" with the integral, so we are to solve that.

 Therefore, the final answer is \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}.

 But wait, let me check the calculation of the integral again:

        ∫_0^1 4t^3 - t^4 dt = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. -> correct.

        Then 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = 864 sqrt(46)/5. -> correct.

 We are done.


==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
The line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) is evaluated along the line segment \(C\) from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\).

1. **Parameterization**:  
   - Let \(t\) range from 0 to 1.

     \]  
   - Factor out constants:  
     \[
     216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt.
     \]  

4. **Integration**:  
   - Compute \(\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt\):  
     \[
     \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) - 0 = \frac{4}{5}.
     \]  

5. **Final Calculation**:  
   - Multiply by the constant factor:  
     \[
     216 \sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}.
     \]  

The evaluated line integral is \(\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}\).

\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
