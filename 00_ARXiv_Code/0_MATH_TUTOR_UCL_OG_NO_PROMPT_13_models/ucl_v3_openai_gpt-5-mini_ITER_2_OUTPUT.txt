**Calculating an integral expression**

I'm working through an integral: the integrand is 216 t^3 (4 - t) sqrt(46). When I integrate from 0 to 1, it simplifies down to (864/5) sqrt(46). I could express that as 172.8 * sqrt(46), but I think I'll keep it as a fraction. Now, I need to create a JSON object. The problem number is not provided, so I’ll assign it a value of "1". The problem statement should be in plain language without any math symbols.**Creating spoken statements for line integrals**

I'm preparing a spoken statement that says: "Evaluate the line integral of the function x cubed times z with respect to arc length over the curve C, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket." I have to avoid any symbols and use words instead. The type of question here is a "line integral." For the answer type, it should be "scalar value," and I'll ensure the math content is properly represented in TTS format, especially regarding exponents.**Clarifying TTS rules**

I’m sorting out the text-to-speech (TTS) rules for mathematical terms. For a square root, I should say "square root of" and for fractions, it's "numerator over denominator." Additionally, I want to convert numbers into a spoken format; for example, "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six." This format helps maintain clarity. I also should ensure there are no mathematical symbols in the problem statement and aim for consistent TTS formatting while deciding if to spell out numbers or keep numerals.**Outlining TTS formatting for calculations**

I need to ensure that the scratchwork answer values are in an array format, reflecting the calculation steps in TTS semantic language. I’ll vocalize commas in coordinates and apply any nesting depth rules. While there are nested expressions, it’s tricky to pinpoint the exact complexity level. I also need to transform exponents and roots to speech. Verbalizing phrases like "the quantity" will help represent nested elements, and I must emphasize the proper pronunciation of "square root" in my output.**Creating final JSON for integral evaluation**

I’m evaluating the inner integrals: the integral of t cubed is one quarter, and the integral of t to the power of four is one fifth. The value I calculate is two hundred sixteen times the square root of forty-six, multiplied by the quantity of four times one quarter minus one fifth. This simplifies down to eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six. Now, I’ll assemble the JSON, making sure all entries are quoted strings and there are no stray curly braces. Let’s put it together.
