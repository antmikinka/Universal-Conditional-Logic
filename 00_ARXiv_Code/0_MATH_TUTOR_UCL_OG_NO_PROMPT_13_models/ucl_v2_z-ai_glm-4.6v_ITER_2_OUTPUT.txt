Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to recall how to compute a line integral of a scalar function. The formula for a line integral ∫_C f(x, y, z) ds is to parameterize the curve C, express x, y, z in terms of a parameter t, find the differential ds in terms of dt, and then integrate f(x(t), y(t), z(t))) * ds/dt dt over the appropriate interval for t.

First, let's parameterize the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). A line segment can be parameterized using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for parameterizing a line segment from point P0 = (x0, y0, z0) to P1 = (x1, y1, z1) is:

x(t) = x0 + t(x1 - x0)
y(t) = y0 + t(y1 - y0)
z(t) = z0 + t(z1 - z0)

where t ∈ [0, 1].

Let's apply this to our points. P0 is (0, 6, 4) and P1 is (6, 3, 3). So:

x(t) = 0 + t(6 - 0) = 6t
y(t) = 6 + t(3 - 6) = 6 + t(-3) = 6 - 3t
z(t) = 4 + t(3 - 4) = 4 + t(-1) = 4 - t

Now, we need to find ds, the differential arc length. The formula for ds in terms of t is:

ds = √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²] dt

Let's compute the derivatives:

dx/dt = d/dt (6t) = 6
dy/dt = d/dt (6 - 3t) = -3
dz/dt = d/dt (4 - t) = -1

Now, square each derivative:

(dx/dt)² = 6² = 36
(dy/dt)² = (-3)² = 9
(dz/dt)² = (-1)² = 1

Sum these squares:

36 + 9 + 1 = 46

So, ds = √46 dt

Now, the integrand is x³ z. Let's express x, y, z in terms of t:

x(t) = 6t
z(t) = 4 - t

So, x³ z = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = (216t³) * (4 - t) = 216t³(4 - t) = 216(4t³ - t⁴) = 864t³ - 216t⁴

Now, the line integral becomes the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of (x³ z) * ds/dt dt. Wait, actually, ds is √46 dt, so the integral is ∫ (from t=0 to t=1) [x(t)³ z(t)] * √46 dt

We already computed x(t)³ z(t) as 864t³ - 216t⁴, so now we can factor out the constants. Let's write the integral:

∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) * √46 dt

We can factor out 216 from the polynomial:

864 = 216 * 4, and 216 = 216 * 1, so:

864t³ - 216t⁴ = 216(4t³ - t⁴)

So the integral becomes:

216 * √46 * ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt

Now, let's compute the integral of (4t³ - t⁴) dt from 0 to 1.

First, find the antiderivative:

∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt = 4 * (t⁴/4) - (t⁵/5) + C = t⁴ - (t⁵/5) + C

Now, evaluate from 0 to 1:

At t = 1: 1⁴ - (1⁵/5) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

At t = 0: 0⁴ - (0⁵/5) = 0 - 0 = 0

So the integral from 0 to 1 is 4/5 - 0 = 4/5

Now, substitute back into the expression:

216 * √46 * (4/5)

Let's compute this step by step. First, 216 * 4 = 864, so:

864/5 * √46

We can write this as (864√46)/5

Let's check if we can simplify 864/5. 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, but since we're dealing with exact values, we'll keep it as a fraction: 864/5.

Now, let's verify all steps to ensure no mistakes:

1. Parameterization: Correct, using t from 0 to 1, with x(t)=6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t. Correct.

2. Derivatives: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1. Correct.

3. ds calculation: √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36+9+1)=√46. Correct.

4. Integrand substitution: x³z=(6t)³(4-t)=216t³(4-t)=864t³-216t⁴. Correct.

5. Integral setup: ∫₀¹ (864t³-216t⁴)√46 dt. Correct.

6. Factoring: 216(4t³-t⁴)√46. Correct.

7. Antiderivative: ∫(4t³-t⁴)dt = t⁴ - t⁵/5 + C. Correct.

8. Evaluation: At t=1, 1 - 1/5 = 4/5; at t=0, 0. So integral is 4/5. Correct.

9. Final calculation: 216 * √46 * 4/5 = (216*4)/5 * √46 = 864/5 * √46. Correct.

So the final result of the line integral is (864√46)/5.

<|begin_of_box|>To evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z \, ds\) where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), follow these steps:


### **Step 1: Parameterize the Line Segment**  
A line segment from \(P_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)\) to \(P_1 = (x_1, y_1, z_1)\) is parameterized as:  
\[
x(t) = x_0 + t(x_1 - x_0), \quad y(t) = y_0 + t(y_1 - y_0), \quad z(t) = z_0 + t(z_1 - z_0)
\]  
For \(P_0 = (0, 6, 4)\) and \(P_1 = (6, 3, 3)\), substitute:  
\[
x(t) = 0 + t(6 - 0) = 6t, \quad y(t) = 6 + t(3 - 6) = 6 - 3t, \quad z(t) = 4 + t(3 - 4) = 4 - t
\]  
where \(t \in [0, 1]\).


### **Step 2: Compute \(ds\) (Differential Arc Length)**  
The formula for \(ds\) in terms of \(t\) is:  
\[
ds = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]  
Compute derivatives:  
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 6, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = -3, \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = -1
\]  
Square and sum:  
\[
\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2 = 6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 = 36 + 9 + 1 = 46
\]  
Thus:  
\[
ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt
\]


### **Step 3: Substitute into the Integral**  
The integrand \(x^3 z\) becomes:  
\[
x(t)^3 z(t) = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4
\]  
The line integral is now:  
\[
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \sqrt{46} \, dt
\]


### **Step 4: Evaluate the Integral**  
Factor out constants:  
\[
\int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \sqrt{46} \, dt = 216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt
\]  
Compute the antiderivative:  
\[
\int (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt = t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}} + C
\]  
Evaluate from \(0\) to \(1\):  
\[
\left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}} \right]_0^1 = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{5}} \right) - 0 = \frac{4}{5}
\]  
Substitute back:  
\[
216\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}
\]


### **Final Result**  
The value of the line integral is:  
\[
<|begin_of_box|>\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}<|end_of_box|>
\]
