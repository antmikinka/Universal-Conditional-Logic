=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3).

Let me think through this step by step:

1) First, I need to parameterize the line segment C.

The line segment goes from point A = (0, 6, 4) to point B = (6, 3, 3).

A parameterization of a line segment from point A to point B can be written as:
r(t) = A + t(B - A) where t ∈ [0, 1]

So:
r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, 3, 3) - (0, 6, 4)
r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1)
r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t)

So the parametric equations are:
x = 6t
y = 6 - 3t  
z = 4 - t

2) Now I need to find ds, the arc length element.

ds = |r'(t)| dt

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

|r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

So ds = √46 dt

3) Now I can set up the integral:

∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4 - t) √46 dt

= √46 ∫_0^1 216t³(4 - t) dt

= 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt

= 216√46 [4(t⁴/4) - t⁵/5]_0^1

= 216√46 [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1

= 216√46 [1 - 1/5]

= 216√46 [4/5]

= (864/5)√46

Let me double-check this calculation:

∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5

So the integral is 216√46 × 4/5 = (864/5)√46

Let me verify the parameterization and the setup:

- The parameterization r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t ∈ [0, 1] correctly goes from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)
- The derivative r'(t) = (6, -3, -1) is correct
- |r'(t)| = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46 is correct
- The substitution x = 6t, z = 4 - t is correct
- The integral setup is correct

So the final answer should be (864/5)√46.
