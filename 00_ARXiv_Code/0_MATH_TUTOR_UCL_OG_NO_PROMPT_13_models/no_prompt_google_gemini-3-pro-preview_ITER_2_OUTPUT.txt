**Evaluating the Integral Now**

\n\n

I've begun by dissecting the user's request, immediately focusing on the line integral itself, and the image given. I see I must calculate $\int_C x^3z \, ds$. The context is still lacking but I am ready to get to work.


**Parameterizing the Curve**

\n\n

Okay, I'm defining the position vector $\vec{r}(t)$ now for the line segment. I've got the start and end points and am applying the standard formula. The parametrization is crucial. I'm focusing on getting it correct and verifying the direction with $t$ ranging from 0 to 1 to ensure that I trace the segment from $(0, 6, 4)$ to $(6, 3, 3)$. 


**Formulating the Integrand**

\n\n

Alright, I'm now substituting the parametric equations into the integrand, so $x^3z$ becomes $(6t)^3(4-t)$. Then, I'm finding $|\vec{r}'(t)|$, which is a constant, to complete the $ds$ term. The pieces are all there. I'm building out the full integral now.


**Refining the Integration Process**

\n\n

I'm focused on the definite integral now. I have the parameterized integrand and the limits of integration. I've successfully found the antiderivative, and now it's just a matter of evaluating at the bounds. The integral simplifies nicely, and I am close to obtaining a final numerical answer.


**Calculating the Arc Length**

\n\n

I've calculated the differential arc length using the parametrization. The result, $\sqrt{46} \, dt$, seems straightforward. Next, I'm going to formulate the integral by substituting the parametric equations into the original integrand and then multiplying by $ds$.


**Confirming the Solution**

\n\n

I've just finished double-checking all the steps, from parametrization to final evaluation. The calculations look solid, and the final answer, $\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$, is confirmed. I'm satisfied with the accuracy and the systematic approach taken to solve this line integral.


**Reflecting on the Approach**

\n\n

I've been very methodical, re-evaluating each step to catch any errors. I've broken the original integrand down and double-checked the final numerical answer. I'm satisfied the answer is accurate.


**Formulating the Final Solution**

\n\n

I've put together a concise, step-by-step solution, including all the necessary calculations. I've also formatted it clearly and am now ready to present the final answer in the requested format. I am confident in the correctness of my response.


**Summarizing the Problem**

\n\n

My thought process is now fully focused on creating a concise, clear step-by-step solution. I've re-read the function and confirmed the coordinates, double-checked the calculations. I'm ready to present my complete solution and am confident the answer is accurate.




==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral $\int_C x^3z \, ds$ for the given line segment $C$, we need to follow the standard steps: parametrize the curve, find the differential arc length scalar $ds$, substitute these into the integral, and evaluate.

### Step 1: Parametrize the Curve $C$

The curve $C$ is a line segment connecting the point $P_0 = (0, 6, 4)$ to $P_1 = (6, 3, 3)$.
We can create a vector function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ for the line segment using the formula:
$$\mathbf{r}(t) = P_0 + t(P_1 - P_0) \quad \text{for } 0 \le t \le 1$$

First, find the direction vector $\vec{v} = P_1 - P_0$:
$$\vec{v} = \langle 6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4 \rangle = \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle$$

Now, write the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$:
*   $x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t$
*   $y(t) = 6 - 3t$
*   $z(t) = 4 - 1t = 4 - t$

The range for the parameter is $0 \le t \le 1$.

### Step 2: Calculate the Differential Arc Length $ds$

The formula for $ds$ is $|\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, dt$. First, find the derivative vector $\mathbf{r}'(t)$:
$$\mathbf{r}'(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\langle 6t, 6-3t, 4-t \rangle = \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle$$

Next, calculate the magnitude:
$$|\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2}$$
$$|\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}$$

So, we have:
$$ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt$$

### Step 3: Substitute and Set Up the Integral

We substitute $x(t)$, $z(t)$, and $ds$ into the original integral expression $\int_C x^3z \, ds$:

*   The integrand is $x^3z = (6t)^3(4 - t)$.
*   Simplify the term: $(6t)^3 = 216t^3$.
*   So, $x^3z = 216t^3(4 - t) = 216(4t^3 - t^4)$.

Now, set up the definite integral with respect to $t$ from 0 to 1:
$$I = \int_0^1 [216(4t^3 - t^4)] \cdot \sqrt{46} \, dt$$

### Step 4: Evaluate the Integral

Factor out the constants:
$$I = 216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt$$

Find the antiderivative:
$$I = 216\sqrt{46} \left[ \frac{4t^4}{4} - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1$$
$$I = 216\sqrt{46} \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1$$

Evaluate at the boundary points $t=1$ and $t=0$:
$$I = 216\sqrt{46} \left[ \left(1^4 - \frac{1^5}{5}\right) - (0 - 0) \right]$$
$$I = 216\sqrt{46} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{5} \right)$$
$$I = 216\sqrt{46} \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)$$

Finally, multiply the constants:
$$I = \frac{216 \cdot 4 \cdot \sqrt{46}}{5}$$
$$I = \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$$

**Answer:**
The value of the line integral is **$\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}$**.
