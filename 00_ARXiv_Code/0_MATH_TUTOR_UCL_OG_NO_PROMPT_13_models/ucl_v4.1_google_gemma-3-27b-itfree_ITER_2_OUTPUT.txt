        "First, parameterize the line segment C as r of t equals t times the vector 6 minus 0, 3 minus 6, 3 minus 4, which simplifies to r of t equals 6t, 6 minus 3t, 4 minus t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.",
        "Next, compute the derivative of r with respect to t, which is r prime of t equals 6, negative 3, negative 1.",
        "Then, compute the magnitude of r prime of t, which is the square root of 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared, which equals the square root of 36 plus 9 plus 1, which equals the square root of 46.",
        "Now, substitute x equals 6t and z equals 4 minus t into the integrand x cubed z, which gives us (6t) cubed times (4 minus t), which simplifies to 216 t cubed times (4 minus t), which equals 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the power of 4.",

        "The integral of negative 216 t to the power of 4 is negative 216 divided by 5 times t to the power of 5.",
        "Evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1: 216 times 1 to the power of 4 minus 216 divided by 5 times 1 to the power of 5, which equals 216 minus 216 over 5, which equals 216 times 1 minus 1 over 5, which equals 216 times 4 over 5, which equals 864 over 5, which equals 172.8.",
        "Finally, multiply 172.8 by the square root of 46 to get the result: 172.8 times the square root of 46, which is approximately 151.2."
