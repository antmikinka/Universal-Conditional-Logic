Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to recall how to compute a line integral of the form ∫_C f(x, y, z) ds, where C is a line segment. The general approach is to parameterize the curve C, express x, y, z in terms of a parameter (like t), find ds in terms of dt, and then integrate over the parameter interval.

First, let's parameterize the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). The parametric equations for a line segment between two points P0 = (x0, y0, z0) and P1 = (x1, y1, z1) can be written as:

x(t) = x0 + t(x1 - x0)
y(t) = y0 + t(y1 - y0)
z(t) = z0 + t(z1 - z0)

where t ranges from 0 to 1. Let's plug in the points:

x0 = 0, x1 = 6, so x(t) = 0 + t(6 - 0) = 6t
y0 = 6, y1 = 3, so y(t) = 6 + t(3 - 6) = 6 - 3t
z0 = 4, z1 = 3, so z(t) = 4 + t(3 - 4) = 4 - t

Now, we need to find ds. The formula for ds in parametric form is:

ds = √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²] dt

Let's compute the derivatives:

dx/dt = 6
dy/dt = -3
dz/dt = -1

Then, (dx/dt)² = 36, (dy/dt)² = 9, (dz/dt)² = 1. Summing these: 36 + 9 + 1 = 46. So ds = √46 dt.

Now, the integrand is x³ z. Let's express x³ z in terms of t:

x(t) = 6t, so x³ = (6t)³ = 216t³
z(t) = 4 - t
So x³ z = 216t³(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴

Now, the line integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * √46 dt.

We can factor out √46:

√46 ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt

Let's compute the integral term by term. The integral of t³ is t⁴/4, and the integral of t⁴ is t⁵/5. So:

∫ (864t³) dt = 864 * (t⁴/4) = 216t⁴
∫ (216t⁴) dt = 216 * (t⁵/5) = (216/5)t⁵

Evaluating from 0 to 1:

[216(1)⁴ - (216/5)(1)⁵] - [216(0)⁴ - (216/5)(0)⁵] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5

Then multiply by √46:

√46 * (864/5) = (864√46)/5

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Let's verify the parameterization and the derivatives. The points are (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). So the direction vector is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1), which matches the derivatives. Then ds is √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46, that's correct.

The integrand: x³ z. x is 6t, so x³ is 216t³. z is 4 - t. So 216t³*(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴. Correct.

Integral from 0 to 1: ∫(864t³ - 216t⁴)dt = 864*(t⁴/4) - 216*(t⁵/5) = 216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵. Evaluated at 1: 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by √46: (864√46)/5. That seems right.

Let me check if there's any mistake in the parameterization. Alternatively, we can use a different parameter, but t from 0 to 1 is standard. Another way: the length of the line segment is √46, but since we're integrating with respect to ds, the parameterization is correct.

So the final answer should be (864√46)/5. Let me confirm the arithmetic: 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, but we keep it as a fraction. Yep, that's correct.
