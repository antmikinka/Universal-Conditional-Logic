=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The user wants me to evaluate the integral of x³z ds over the curve C, which is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I need to recall how to compute a line integral with respect to arc length.

Line integrals of scalar functions like this require parameterizing the curve C. Since it's a line segment, I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for a line integral is ∫_C f(x,y,z) ds = ∫_a^b f(r(t)) ||r'(t)|| dt, where r(t) is the parameterization of C.

First, let's parameterize the curve. The starting point is (0,6,4) and the endpoint is (6,3,3). The vector from start to end is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization r(t) can be written as:

r(t) = (0,6,4) + t(6, -3, -1) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds. ds is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, multiplied by dt. So compute r'(t):

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). The magnitude ||r'(t)|| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46).

Now, express the integrand x³z in terms of t. From the parameterization, x = 6t and z = 4 - t. So x³z = (6t)³(4 - t) = 216t³(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴.

Putting it all together, the integral becomes:

∫ from t=0 to t=1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt.

Factor out sqrt(46):

sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt.

Compute the integral term by term:

∫864t³ dt = 864*(t⁴/4) = 216t⁴

∫216t⁴ dt = 216*(t⁵/5) = (216/5)t⁵

So evaluating from 0 to 1:

216*(1)^4 - (216/5)*(1)^5 - [0 - 0] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5.

Multiply by sqrt(46):

sqrt(46) * (864/5) = (864/5)sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let's see:

864t³ integrated is 864*(t^4/4) = 216t^4, correct.

-216t^4 integrated is -216*(t^5/5) = - (216/5)t^5.

At t=1: 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Yes, that's right.

So the final answer should be (864/5)√46.

Let me verify if the parameterization is correct. At t=0: (0,6,4), correct. At t=1: (6,3,3), correct. The direction vector is correct. The magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(36 +9 +1)=sqrt(46), correct.

The integrand substitution: x=6t, z=4-t, so x³z=(6t)^3*(4-t)=216t³*(4-t)=864t³-216t^4. Correct.

Integrating from 0 to1: yes. So the result is 864/5 * sqrt(46).

I think that's correct. Let me just check if the integral steps are right.

Integral of 864t³ from 0 to1 is 864*(1/4) = 216.

Integral of -216t^4 is -216*(1/5) = -43.2.

216 -43.2 = 172.8. 864/5 is 172.8, which matches. So 172.8 * sqrt(46). So yes, (864/5)sqrt(46) is the exact value.

Therefore, the final answer is (864√46)/5.
