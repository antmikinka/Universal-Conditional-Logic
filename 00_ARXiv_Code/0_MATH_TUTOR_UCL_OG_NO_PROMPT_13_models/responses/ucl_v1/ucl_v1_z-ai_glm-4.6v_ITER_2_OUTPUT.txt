=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to recall how to parameterize a line segment for a line integral. 

The line segment C is from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). To parameterize this, I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The parametric equations for a line segment from point P0 to P1 are:

x(t) = x0 + t(x1 - x0)
y(t) = y0 + t(y1 - y0)
z(t) = z0 + t(z1 - z0)

Let's plug in the coordinates. P0 is (0, 6, 4) and P1 is (6, 3, 3). So:

x(t) = 0 + t(6 - 0) = 6t
y(t) = 6 + t(3 - 6) = 6 - 3t
z(t) = 4 + t(3 - 4) = 4 - t

Now, we need to find ds, the differential arc length. The formula for ds in terms of t is:

ds = sqrt[(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2] dt

Let's compute the derivatives:

dx/dt = 6
dy/dt = -3
dz/dt = -1

Now, square each derivative:

(dx/dt)^2 = 36
(dy/dt)^2 = 9
(dz/dt)^2 = 1

Sum them up: 36 + 9 + 1 = 46

So, ds = sqrt(46) dt

Now, the line integral is ∫_C x^3 z ds. Let's substitute the parametric equations and ds into the integral.

First, substitute x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t, and ds = sqrt(46) dt. The limits of t are from 0 to 1 (since t=0 is the starting point (0,6,4)) and t=1 is the ending point (6,3,3)).

So the integral becomes:

∫ (from t=0 to t=1) [ (6t)^3 * (4 - t) ] * sqrt(46) dt

Let's simplify the integrand step by step.

First, compute (6t)^3: 6^3 = 216, so (6t)^3 = 216 t^3

Then, multiply by (4 - t): 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 * 4 - 216 t^3 * t = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

Now, multiply by sqrt(46): so the integrand is (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) * sqrt(46)

We can factor out 216 t^3 from the first two terms? Wait, 864 is 4*216, and 216 is 1*216. So:

864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 t^3 (4 - t)

Which is what we had before. So now, the integral is:

sqrt(46) * ∫ (from 0 to 1) 216 t^3 (4 - t) dt

Let's factor out the constant 216:

216 sqrt(46) * ∫ (from 0 to 1) t^3 (4 - t) dt

Now, expand the integrand t^3 (4 - t) = 4 t^3 - t^4

So the integral becomes:

216 sqrt(46) * ∫ (from 0 to 1) (4 t^3 - t^4) dt

Now, integrate term by term. The integral of 4 t^3 is 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4. The integral of -t^4 is - (t^5 / 5) = -t^5 / 5.

So evaluating from 0 to 1:

[ t^4 - (t^5 / 5) ] from 0 to 1 = (1^4 - (1^5 / 5))) - (0 - 0) = (1 - 1/5) = (4/5)

So now, substitute back into the expression:

216 sqrt(46) * (4/5)

Let's compute 216 * 4 / 5. 216 * 4 = 864. Then 864 / 5 = 172.8, but let's keep it as a fraction: 864/5.

So the final result is (864/5) sqrt(46). We can simplify this by factoring out common terms, but let's check if 864 and 5 have any common factors (they don't, since 5 is prime and 864 is divisible by 2, 3, etc., but not 5). So the simplified form is (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, parameterization: x(t)=6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t. Correct, since at t=0, we get (0,6,4), and at t=1, (6,3,3). Correct.

Derivatives: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1. Correct.

ds calculation: sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). Correct.

Integrand substitution: x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t). Correct.

Expanding the integrand: 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4. Correct.

Integrating term by term: ∫ (4 t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1. The integral of 4 t^3 is t^4, and the integral of -t^4 is -t^5/5. Evaluating from 0 to 1: (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5. Correct.

Multiplying by the constants: 216 * (4/5) * sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46). Correct.

So the final answer is (864 sqrt(46)) / 5. Let's write that in a more compact form, maybe factoring out 864 and 5, but it's already simplified.
