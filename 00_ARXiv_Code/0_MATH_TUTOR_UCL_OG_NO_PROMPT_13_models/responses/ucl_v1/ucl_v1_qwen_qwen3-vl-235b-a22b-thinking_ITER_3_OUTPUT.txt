=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The user wants me to evaluate the integral of x cubed times z ds over the curve C, which is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I need to parameterize the line segment. A line segment between two points can be parameterized using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for a line segment from point A to point B is r(t) = A + t(B - A). 

So, the starting point A is (0,6,4) and the endpoint B is (6,3,3). Let's compute B - A: (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization should be r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds, which is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, multiplied by dt. Let's compute dr/dt. The derivative of r(t) is (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integrand is x³ z. From the parameterization, x = 6t, z = 4 - t. So substituting these in, the integrand becomes (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216 (4t³ - t⁴).

Putting it all together, the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [216 (4t³ - t⁴)] * sqrt(46) dt. We can factor out the constants: 216 sqrt(46) times the integral from 0 to 1 of (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Calculating the integral: the antiderivative of 4t³ is t⁴, and of -t⁴ is -t⁵/5. So evaluating from 0 to 1: (1⁴ - (1⁵)/5) - (0 - 0) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

Multiply by 216 sqrt(46): 216 * (4/5) * sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46). Let me check the arithmetic: 216*4 is 864, yes. So the final answer is 864/5 times sqrt(46).

Wait, let me double-check the parameterization. x goes from 0 to 6, so 6t is correct. y goes from 6 to 3, so 6 - 3t, which at t=1 is 3. z goes from 4 to 3, so 4 - t, which at t=1 is 3. That's right.

ds: derivative components 6, -3, -1. Squared terms 36,9,1 sum to 46, sqrt(46) is correct.

Integrand substitution: x=6t, so x³ is 216 t³. z is 4 - t. So product is 216 t³ (4 - t). Correct.

Integral of 4t³ - t⁴ from 0 to1: yes, 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Multiply by 216*sqrt(46): 216*4/5 = 864/5. So the answer is (864/5)√46.

I think that's it. Now, the problem is a line integral in vector calculus, so the processing framework should apply the vector calculus case. The answer should be in a format that's TTS-ready, so converting the mathematical expressions into spoken language. The final answer is 864 over 5 times the square root of 46.
