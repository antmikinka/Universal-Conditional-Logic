=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to recall how to evaluate a line integral over a line segment. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I should parameterize the line segment. Let's denote the starting point as P0 = (0,6,4) and the ending point as P1 = (6,3,3). The parameterization of a line segment can be done using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. So, the parametric equations would be:

x(t) = x0 + t(x1 - x0) = 0 + t(6 - 0) = 6t  
y(t) = y0 + t(y1 - y0) = 6 + t(3 - 6) = 6 - 3t  
z(t) = z0 + t(z1 - z0) = 4 + t(3 - 4) = 4 - t  

Now, we need to find ds, which is the differential arc length. The formula for ds in terms of t is ds = √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²] dt. Let's compute the derivatives:

dx/dt = 6  
dy/dt = -3  
dz/dt = -1  

So, (dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)² = 6² + (-3)² + (-1)² = 36 + 9 + 1 = 46. Therefore, ds = √46 dt.

Now, substitute x(t), z(t), and ds into the integral. The integral becomes:

∫ (from t=0 to t=1) [x(t)]³ * z(t) * ds  
= ∫₀¹ (6t)³ * (4 - t) * √46 dt  
Let's expand (6t)³: 6³ t³ = 216 t³. So the integrand is 216 t³ (4 - t) √46. Let's distribute that:

216 √46 ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt  

Now, integrate term by term. The integral of 4t³ is 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴, and the integral of t⁴ is t⁵/5. So:

216 √46 [ t⁴ - t⁵/5 ] from 0 to 1  

Evaluate at t=1: 1⁴ - 1⁵/5 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5  
Evaluate at t=0: 0 - 0 = 0  

So the integral is 216 √46 * (4/5) = (864/5) √46. Let me check the calculations again to make sure. 

Wait, let's verify the parameterization. The direction vector from P0 to P1 is (6, -3, -1), so the parametric equations are correct. The derivatives are 6, -3, -1, so the magnitude squared is 36 + 9 + 1 = 46, so ds = √46 dt is correct. Then x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t, so x³z = (6t)³(4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Expanding that gives 864 t³ - 216 t⁴. Then integrating from 0 to 1: ∫(864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt = 864*(t⁴/4) - 216*(t⁵/5) = 216 t⁴ - (216/5) t⁵. Evaluated at 1: 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by √46, so the result is (864/5)√46. That seems right.
