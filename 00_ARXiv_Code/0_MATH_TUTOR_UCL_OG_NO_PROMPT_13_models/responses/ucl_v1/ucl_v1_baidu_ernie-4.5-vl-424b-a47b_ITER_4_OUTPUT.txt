=== REASONING / THINKING ===

We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

To evaluate this line integral, we can parameterize the curve C.

Let the parameter t go from 0 to 1.

Let the starting point be (x0, y0, z0) = (0,6,4) and the ending point be (x1, y1, z1) = (6,3,3).

Then a linear parameterization is:

x(t) = (1-t)*0 + t*6 = 6t
y(t) = (1-t)*6 + t*3 = 6 - 3t
z(t) = (1-t)*4 + t*3 = 4 - t

Now, we need to compute the arc length element ds. This is given by:

ds = |r'(t)| dt

First, find the derivative of the position vector r(t) = <x(t), y(t), z(t)>:

r'(t) = <dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt> = <6, -3, -1>

Then, |r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

So, ds = √46 dt.

Now, we can write the integral in terms of t:

x(t) = 6t
z(t) = 4 - t

So, x(t)³ = (6t)³ = 216 t³

Thus, the integrand becomes: x³ z ds = (216 t³) * (4 - t) * √46 dt

Therefore, the integral is:

∫_{t=0}^{1} 216 t³ (4 - t) √46 dt

We can factor out the constants:

= 216 √46 ∫_{0}^{1} t³ (4 - t) dt

Now, expand the integrand:

t³ (4 - t) = 4t³ - t⁴

So, the integral becomes:

216 √46 ∫_{0}^{1} (4t³ - t⁴) dt

Integrate term by term:

∫4t³ dt = 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴
∫t⁴ dt = t⁵/5

Thus, ∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt = t⁴ - t⁵/5

Evaluate from 0 to 1:

At t=1: 1⁴ - 1⁵/5 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5
At t=0: 0

So, the definite integral is 4/5.

Therefore, the entire expression is:

216 √46 * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) * √46 = (864 / 5) * √46

Simplify 864/5 = 172.8, but we'll keep it as a fraction.

So, 864/5 √46

We can write it as (864 √46) / 5.

Alternatively, we can leave it as 216 * 4 * √46 / 5, which is the same.

Now, we are to output in JSON format as per the specification.

Since this is a single problem, we assign a problem number and state the problem.

The question type: This is a free response, but note that in the condition for fill_in_blanks we have protocols. However, the problem does not specify multiple choice or blanks. It is a calculation. So we can treat it as a free response.

In the processing_framework, for free response we don't have a specific CASE. We use the DEFAULT which applies minimal tracking.

Also, note that the math_content_check is "yes".

We'll structure the JSON accordingly.

Problem statement: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

Final answer: The value of the integral is (864 √46) / 5.

Alternatively, we can write it as (864/5) √46.

We'll use the fraction form.

Scratchwork: We have shown the steps, so we can include a summary of the steps in TTS format.

But note the output specification: 
  "final_answers": {
    "main_answer": { ... },
    "scratchwork_answer": { ... }
  }

We are to provide TTS ready strings.

For main_answer, the value is a number: (864 √46) / 5

We can write it in words for TTS: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, divided by five" but note that division might be tricky. Alternatively, we can write it as a fraction: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six". However, the problem might expect a simplified form.

Alternatively, we can leave it as a mathematical expression in TTS form: "open parenthesis eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six, close parenthesis, divided by five". But the specification says "tts_ready" meaning it should be spoken naturally.

In the tts_transformation_rules, we have rules for fractions: "numerator over denominator", so we can use that.

But note that √46 is an irrational number, so we cannot simplify the expression. We can leave it as:

" ( 864 / 5 ) square root of 46 " but that might not be clear.

Alternatively, we can write: " eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, over five"

That would be: numerator = "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six", denominator = "five". But in the fraction rule, we require numerator and denominator as separate parts. However, the numerator has two factors: 864 and √46. We can combine them as "eight hundred sixty-four square root forty-six" but that might be misinterpreted as the product without the radical.

Actually, in TTS, we can say: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six" and then "divided by five", but that is two parts. The fraction rule is for a simple fraction. Here, we have a product in the numerator.

Alternatively, we can write the entire expression as a fraction: (864 √46) / 5, so the numerator is "eight hundred sixty-four square root forty-six" and the denominator is "five", but note that "eight hundred sixty-four square root forty-six" is not standard. It would be clearer to say: "eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six, all over five".

But the specification says: "fraction_format": "numerator over denominator", so we can use:

For the main_answer: we can have a single string for the value? Or the values can be an array? The template says "values": [ ... ] so an array.

We can break the expression into parts. However, the problem is a single expression. Alternatively, we can output the entire expression as one string.

Looking at the template: "values": [{{concept:answer_values:tts_semantic_format}}] - meaning a list of answer values. Since it's a single value, we can put a single string.

But note: in the multiple choice cases, we have single letter responses. This is a numerical expression. We can output it as a single string.

Alternatively, if the answer were a number that can be read directly, we could. But here it's an expression.

We can write: " \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} " but in TTS? We have to convert to spoken form.

Alternatively, we can compute an approximate value? The problem does not specify, and we are to preserve accuracy.

But the specification says "preserving mathematical_accuracy", so we must keep it exact.

So, we'll output the expression in words.

Let me write a TTS version:

We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five" meaning the same as (864 √46)/5.

Alternatively, to be clear: "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, divided by five" but that's redundant.

The rule for exponent is there, but we don't have an exponent. The rule for squareroot: "square root of ...", and for fraction: "numerator over denominator". But here, the numerator is 864 √46, which is a product. We don't have a rule for product. However, we can use the fact that in TTS we can just state the expression.

Since the entire expression is (864 √46) / 5, we can split it as:

We have a fraction: numerator = "eight hundred sixty-four square root forty-six", but that might be confusing because it sounds like 864√46 is a single term. We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six" for the numerator, and then "divided by five" for the denominator? But that is not a single fraction.

Alternatively, we can treat the entire expression as a fraction: numerator is "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six", denominator is "five". But in the fraction rule, we require a single numerator and denominator. The product in the numerator is acceptable in spoken form: we don't break it.

So, I think: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, over five" is acceptable.

Similarly, for scratchwork, we have multiple steps. We can output each step in TTS format.

But note: the scratchwork_answer has values as an array. We can break the steps.

However, the problem is straightforward, and we have a few steps.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Parameterize the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3):
   x(t)=6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t, for t in [0,1].

2. Compute r'(t) = <6, -3, -1>, and |r'(t)| = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46).

3. ds = sqrt(46) dt.

4. Integrand: x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t).

5. Integral: ∫ from 0 to 1 of 216 t^3 (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt = 216 sqrt(46) ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1.

6. Compute integral: [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

7. Multiply: 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (216*4/5) sqrt(46) = 864/5 sqrt(46).

We can write each step as a string in TTS format.

But note: the specification says "scratchwork_answer" with values as an array. We can put each step as a separate string.

Alternatively, we can combine, but the array is for multiple parts. We'll put each step.

However, the self_validation_protocol requires that for multiple blanks we number them, but here we don't have blanks. We are providing scratchwork.

We'll create an array of TTS strings for the steps.

Now, for the JSON output.

Problem number: let's say "1" (since it's the first problem).

Problem statement: the given problem.

Question type: we don't have a multiple choice or blanks. We can classify it as "free_response". But in the framework, we have a DEFAULT case that applies minimal tracking. So in the output, "question_type" can be "free_response".

Alternatively, note that in the condition for fill_in_blanks, but we don't have blanks. So we use the default.

But the problem does not have multiple choice or multiple blanks. So we'll use:

"question_type": "free_response"

But in the output specification, the example does not specify, so we can define a type.

Alternatively, we can use "calculation" as a type? The framework doesn't specify a type for free response. We can use "free_response".

Alternatively, we can leave the question_type as "unknown" but that's not good.

Looking at the condition in the processing_framework: the SWITCH for question_type has multiple_choice_square, multiple_choice_circle, multiple_selection, fill_in_blanks, and then domains. But note the domains are for the mathematical domain, not the question type.

In the SWITCH for question_type, we have:

- multiple_choice_square
- multiple_choice_circle
- multiple_selection
- fill_in_blanks
- and then domains (which are for content, not question type)

Then the DEFAULT applies minimal tracking.

So for this question, it's not multiple choice, not multiple selection, not fill-in-blanks. So it falls into DEFAULT.

But we are to output the "question_type" as determined by the classification. So we can output "default" or "free_response". Let's use "free_response".

Alternatively, we can create a new type? The specification does not forbid, so we can set:

"question_type": "free_response"

Now, math_content_check: "yes"

Final_answers:
  main_answer: type: "expression", values: ["eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"]
  But note: the type should be a classification. We can classify it as "exact_value". However, the framework doesn't specify. We can use the type as "expression". Alternatively, we can leave it as "scalar" if it were a number, but it is an expression.

Alternatively, we can look at the answer_category: in the main_answer, it has "type": ... We can use "expression" or "fraction", but it's a product and fraction.

Alternatively, we can use a generic type "answer". But to be specific, we can use "expression".

Alternatively, note that in the multiple choice cases, we enforce single letter response. This is not the case, so we don't enforce that.

Similarly, for scratchwork, we have:
  "scratchwork_answer": {
      "values": [ ... array of TTS strings for each step ... ]
  }

Now, let's write the TTS for the main answer. We decided: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

But to be more accurate, we can say: "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, divided by five" but that is the same as putting it over five.

Alternatively, we can use the fraction rule: 
  We can break it as: 
      numerator: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six" 
      denominator: "five"
  but the value would be an array of two strings? However, the values for main_answer is an array of answer values. We can have an array of two strings? But that doesn't represent a fraction.

Alternatively, we can output the entire fraction as one string. I think that is acceptable.

So for main_answer:
  "type": "expression"
  "values": [ "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five" ]

Alternatively, we can output it as a mathematical expression in LaTeX? But the specification says TTS ready. So natural spoken language.

Alternatively, we can compute the value: sqrt(46) is about 6.782, so 864 * 6.782 = about 5860, then divided by 5 is 1172? But we must preserve exact form.

So we stick to exact form.

Now, for scratchwork, we'll create an array of TTS strings for each step.

Example step: "Parameterize the line segment: x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, for t from zero to one."

Another step: "Compute the derivative: r prime of t equals <6, -3, -1>."

Another step: "The magnitude of the derivative is square root of (6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = square root of 46."

Another step: "So, d s equals square root of 46 d t."

Another step: "The integrand is x cubed times z, which is (6t)^3 times (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t)."

Another step: "The integral becomes 216 times square root of 46 times the integral of (4t^3 - t^4) from t=0 to t=1."

Another step: "The antiderivative of 4t^3 - t^4 is t^4 - (t^5)/5."

Another step: "Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives (1 - 1/5) = 4/5."

Another step: "Multiply: 216 * square root of 46 * 4/5 = 864/5 * square root of 46."

We can write each step as a separate string in an array.

Now, we are ready to create the JSON.

Note: the problem number is not specified, so we assign "1".

Let me write the JSON.

**Explanation of Key Steps:**
- The line segment is parameterized with \( t \in [0, 1] \), giving \( x(t) = 6t \), \( y(t) = 6 - 3t \), \( z(t) = 4 - t \).
- Derivative vector: \( \mathbf{r}'(t) = \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle \), with magnitude \( \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{46} \).
- Arc length element: \( ds = \sqrt{46}  dt \).
- Integrand substitution: \( x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) \).
- Integral simplifies to \( 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt \).
- Antiderivative: \( t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \), evaluated to \( \frac{4}{5} \) over \([0,1]\).
- Final result: \( 216 \sqrt{46} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} \), rendered in TTS-compatible natural language.
