We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 Steps:
 1. Parameterize the line segment C.
 2. Express x, y, z, and the speed (ds/dt) in terms of the parameter t.
 3. Convert the integral to an integral with respect to t.
 4. Evaluate the integral.

 Parameterization:
   Let t go from 0 to 1.
   Point A: (0,6,4), Point B: (6,3,3)
   r(t) = (1-t) * A + t * B = (1-t)(0,6,4) + t(6,3,3) 
          = (0, 6-6t, 4-4t) + (6t, 3t, 3t) 
          = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)   ??? Let me recalc:

   Actually: 
      x(t) = 0*(1-t) + 6t = 6t
      y(t) = 6*(1-t) + 3t = 6 - 6t + 3t = 6 - 3t
      z(t) = 4*(1-t) + 3t = 4 - 4t + 3t = 4 - t

   So: r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t),  t ∈ [0,1]

 2. Derivatives:
      dx/dt = 6
      dy/dt = -3
      dz/dt = -1

   The speed: ds/dt = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) 
               = sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

 3. The integral becomes:
      ∫_C x³ z ds = ∫_{t=0}^{1} [ (6t)^3 * (4-t) ] * sqrt(46) dt
                   = sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} (216 t³) (4 - t) dt
                   = sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫_{0}^{1} (4t³ - t⁴) dt

 4. Compute the integral of (4t³ - t⁴) from 0 to 1:
      ∫(4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t^4 - (t^5)/5] from 0 to 1? Let me do it properly:

      Actually: ∫(4t³ - t⁴) dt = 4*(t^4/4) - (t^5)/5 = t^4 - t^5/5

      At t=1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5
      At t=0: 0

      So the integral is 4/5.

 5. Then the whole integral is: sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5) = (216 * 4 * sqrt(46)) / 5 = (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5

 But let me compute 216 * 4/5:
      216 * 4 = 864, then 864/5 = 172.8

 So the result is (172.8 * sqrt(46)) -> but we should leave as fraction? Actually 216/5 = 43.2, so 43.2 * 4 = 172.8? 
 Alternatively, 864/5 * sqrt(46) = 864 sqrt(46) / 5

 However, we can write as: 
      = (216 * 4 * sqrt(46)) / 5
      = (864 sqrt(46)) / 5

 But note: 216 and 5 have no common factors? So we can leave as simplified fraction.

 However, the problem says "TTS compatible" and "natural language", but for scratchwork we need to show steps in TTS format.

 But note: the problem requires output in JSON with TTS-ready strings.

 However, the problem_statement is given as: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

 We are to output:
   "problem_number": We can set to "1" since it's the only problem.
   "problem_statement": The given problem.
   "question_type": "open_ended"
   "math_content_check": "yes"
   "final_answers": 
        "main_answer": type "single_value", values = [ ... the answer in TTS-ready string ... ]
        "scratchwork_answer": key steps

 How to represent the answer? We have: 864 sqrt(46) / 5

 In TTS-ready: We can say: "864 square root of 46 over 5" but note that division over 5 might be ambiguous.

 Alternatively, we can write as a decimal? But the problem doesn't specify. However, the scratchwork should show the exact form.

 Since the problem says "TTS-ready", we should use exact fraction and radicals.

 How about: "the quantity 864 times the square root of 46, all divided by 5"

 But note: the problem may expect the answer in a boxed format? The instruction says to output in JSON.

 Let me structure:

 Steps in scratchwork (in TTS-ready natural language):

 1. Parameterize the curve: 
        "Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1. Then the position vector r(t) is: 6t comma 6 minus 3t comma 4 minus t."
 2. Calculate derivatives: 
        "The derivative of x is 6, derivative of y is negative 3, derivative of z is negative 1."
 3. Speed: 
        "The speed is the square root of the quantity: 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared; end quantity, which is square root of 46."
 4. Substitute into integral:
        "The integral becomes: square root of 46 multiplied by the integral from 0 to 1 of: the quantity x cubed times z, which is the quantity: 6t cubed times the quantity: 4 minus t; end quantity, dt."
        Simplify: "That is square root of 46 multiplied by 216 multiplied by the integral from 0 to 1 of: the quantity 4t cubed minus t to the fourth; end quantity, dt."
 5. Evaluate integral:
        "The integral of 4t cubed minus t to the fourth from 0 to 1 is: t to the fourth minus one fifth of t to the fifth evaluated from 0 to 1, which gives 1 minus one fifth equals four fifths."
 6. Final computation:
        "Therefore, the entire integral is square root of 46 multiplied by 216 multiplied by four fifths, which equals the quantity 864 square root of 46 end quantity divided by 5."

 But note: the problem requires the scratchwork to be in a list of key steps and results.

 We'll break into key steps:

 Step 1: Parameterization
   "r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t) for t in [0,1]."

 Step 2: Derivatives
   "dr/dt = (6, -3, -1)"

 Step 3: Speed
   "ds/dt = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(46)"

 Step 4: The integrand in terms of t:
   "x = 6t, z = 4-t, so x³z = (6t)^3*(4-t) = 216 t³ (4-t)"

 Step 5: The integral in t:
   "Integral = sqrt(46) * ∫_0^1 216 t³ (4-t) dt = sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t^4) dt"

 Step 6: Compute the integral inside:
   "∫_0^1 (4t³ - t^4) dt = [t^4 - (t^5)/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5"

 Step 7: Final result:
   "Result = sqrt(46) * 216 * 4/5 = 864 sqrt(46) / 5"

 Now, we must write the main_answer in TTS-ready: 
        "the quantity 864 square root of 46 over 5; end quantity" 
   or more naturally: "864 square root of 46 over 5"

 But note: the example used "end quantity" for nested groups. Here we have a fraction, so we can do:

        "864 times the square root of 46, divided by 5"

 However, the instructions say to use "quantity" for parentheses and nested expressions. But this is a fraction. We can treat the entire fraction as a primary grouping? Actually, we don't have parentheses. We want to avoid saying "over" without grouping? But "over" is allowed in the conversion rules.

 Alternatively, we can break the fraction:

        "864 multiplied by the square root of 46, and then divided by 5"

 But that might be too long.

 Since the instruction says to use "quantity" for parentheses and nested expressions, and here we have a single fraction, we can simply say:

        "the fraction with numerator 864 square root of 46 and denominator 5"

 But that is not in the conversion rules. The rules say to use "over".

 In the conversion rules: Fractions are described as "numerator over denominator". However, we have a product in the numerator. We can group the entire numerator? But the numerator is a product: 864 sqrt(46). We don't have parentheses in the expression. So we can say:

        "864 times square root of 46 over 5"

 But to avoid ambiguity, we can use grouping for the entire fraction? Actually, in the absence of parentheses, we read it as (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 The rule says: For complex division, use "quantity". But here we have a single fraction. We can interpret the entire fraction as a secondary grouping? However, the expression "864 sqrt(46)/5" does not have explicit parentheses. But we are to preserve structural integrity.

 Alternatively, we can use:

        "the quantity 864 square root of 46, all over 5"

 This is acceptable.

 However, note the example: 
      (a+b)/(c+d) -> "the quantity a plus b, all divided by the quantity c plus d"

 Here, we don't have a complex numerator? The numerator is a product, but it's not an expression with an operator that would cause ambiguity. However, to be safe, we can treat the entire numerator as a unit? Actually, 864 is a constant and sqrt(46) is a constant. So:

        "864 times square root of 46, divided by 5"

 But that is acceptable.

 However, the instruction says: "Use natural language grouping "quantity" exclusively for all parentheses handling". Here there are no parentheses. So we can just say:

        "864 times the square root of 46 over 5"

 But to be clear, we can break it with a pause (comma would be used in a list, but here it's a fraction). Alternatively, we can use:

        "the quantity 864 square root of 46, all over 5"

 But note: the numerator is 864*sqrt(46). We don't have parentheses around that? But in math, multiplication is implied. However, to avoid reading as 864*sqrt(46/5) (which would be wrong) we should group. But our expression is written as 864 sqrt(46) / 5, which is (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 We'll do: "the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity, over 5"

 But wait, we have two groupings? The rules say to use hierarchical grouping. Here, the entire fraction is the main structure? Alternatively, we can use:

        "the fraction with numerator: 864 times the square root of 46; and denominator: 5"

 But that is more complex.

 Alternatively, we can say:

        "864 square root of 46 divided by 5"

 without grouping? But that might be ambiguous: is it 864 * (sqrt(46)/5) or (864*sqrt(46))/5? Since multiplication and division have the same precedence, it would be left to right? But we want it as a whole.

 Since the expression is written as 864 sqrt(46)/5, we want the TTS to reflect that. The intended grouping is (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5. We can say:

        "864 multiplied by the square root of 46, and then divided by 5"

 This is clear.

 But the conversion rules don't have an example for fractions without parentheses. The example was for a division of two expressions: (a+b)/(c+d). Here we have a constant times a radical divided by a constant.

 We'll go with: "864 times the square root of 46 divided by 5"

 However, to be precise and safe, we can use grouping for the entire fraction? But the expression doesn't have parentheses. We are to preserve structure. We can use the primary grouping for the entire fraction? But the entire expression is the fraction? Actually, the answer is the fraction.

 The rule for fractions: "numerator over denominator". So:

        "the fraction: numerator 864 times the square root of 46; denominator 5; end fraction"

 But the rules do not have an example of a fraction with a compound numerator. However, we are allowed to use the primary grouping for the entire fraction? Actually, the rules say to use "quantity" for parentheses. Here we don't have parentheses? But we are generating for TTS, and we must eliminate ambiguity.

 Since 864 times square root of 46 is one term? Actually, it's two terms multiplied. We can treat the entire numerator as a primary grouping? 

        "the fraction: numerator, the quantity 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity; denominator 5; end fraction"

 But that seems too heavy.

 Alternatively, we can break it naturally:

        "a fraction with numerator: 864 times the square root of 46, and denominator: 5"

 But the instruction says to use "quantity" for grouping. We can do without if clear? But to be safe, we'll follow the rule.

 The simplest: we can write the numerator as a primary grouping because without grouping, "864 times square root of 46 over 5" might be interpreted as 864 * (sqrt(46)/5). But that is not what we want.

 Therefore, we will group the numerator:

        "the fraction: numerator, the quantity 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity; denominator, 5; end fraction"

 But the rules don't have an example for fractions. The rule for division: 
        (a+b)/(c+d) -> "the quantity a plus b, all divided by the quantity c plus d"

 We can extend: 
        numerator: 864 * sqrt(46) -> we can say: "a times b" is just "a times b", but if we want to group the entire numerator we can say "the quantity 864 times the square root of 46" but that is not necessary? Because 864 and sqrt(46) are both constants? Actually, the numerator is a product of two constants. It is unambiguous? 

 However, note: the expression is 864 sqrt(46)/5. Without parentheses, it is (864 sqrt(46)) / 5? Yes, because sqrt(46) is a function applied to 46, so it's 864 * (sqrt(46)) then divided by 5? Actually, the dot for multiplication is omitted, so it's 864 * sqrt(46) / 5. But in math, multiplication and division are left associative? So it would be ((864 * sqrt(46)) / 5). 

 So we can say without grouping:

        "864 times the square root of 46 over 5"

 but that is ambiguous in speech? The word "over" might be associated with the square root? We want to avoid that.

 We decide: use grouping for the entire numerator as a quantity? But note the instruction: "Use natural language grouping "quantity" exclusively for all parentheses handling". Here, we don't have parentheses, but we are allowed to use grouping to preserve meaning? Because in the written form, the numerator is not enclosed in parentheses? However, we are to convert for TTS, and we must avoid ambiguity.

 We'll do:

        "the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; all over 5"

 However, the entire fraction doesn't have parentheses? But we are grouping the numerator as a unit? Actually, we are not. We are breaking the fraction: we are saying the numerator is one quantity and then we say "over 5". That is effectively the same as the fraction.

 Alternatively, we can say:

        "the quantity 864 square root of 46 over 5" -> but that is the same as without grouping? 

 We need to group the numerator because if we don't, the TTS might read: "864 times the square root of 46 over 5" -> which might be misheard as 864 * sqrt(46/5). 

 Therefore, we must group the numerator:

        "the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity, over 5"

 But note: the example had two expressions separated by over. Here we have a compound numerator. So we group the entire numerator into one quantity? Then we say "over 5". That would be clear.

 So: 
        main_answer: "the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity, over 5"

 However, the rule for the fraction in the example didn't have a compound numerator. But the principle is the same: we group expressions that go together.

 Alternatively, we can avoid grouping if the numerator is a single term? In this case, 864*sqrt(46) is a product of two terms. We can consider it a single expression? But in TTS, we want to make sure it is read as a unit.

 We'll use: 
        "the quantity 864 times square root of 46 end quantity over 5"

 But to be consistent with the example, we use:

        "the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity, divided by 5"

 Actually, the example used "divided by" for the entire fraction? No, in the example: 
        (a+b)/(c+d) -> "the quantity a plus b, all divided by the quantity c plus d"

 We are adapting: numerator is a quantity, then we say "divided by" the denominator? But the denominator is 5, which is simple.

 Therefore, we'll say:

        "the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; all divided by 5"

 But note: the denominator is a single number. We don't need to group it.

 Alternatively, we can do:

        "the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity, divided by 5"

 Let's choose that.

 However, the scratchwork must be in TTS-ready and we have to show the key steps.

 We'll write the scratchwork as a list of strings, each string being TTS-ready.

 Steps for scratchwork:

 Step 1: Parameterization: 
        "Parameterize the curve C: r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), for t from 0 to 1."
 Step 2: Derivatives: 
        "dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1."
 Step 3: Speed: 
        "ds/dt = square root of (6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared) = square root of 46."
 Step 4: Integrand: 
        "The integrand x cubed z becomes: (6t)^3 times (4 - t) = 216 t cubed times (4 - t)."
 Step 5: Rewrite the integral: 
        "The line integral becomes: square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of 216 t cubed (4 - t) dt."
        "Simplify the integral: 216 times integral from 0 to 1 of (4t^3 - t^4) dt."
 Step 6: Compute the integral of the polynomial: 
        "The antiderivative of 4t^3 is t^4, and of -t^4 is negative one fifth t to the fifth."
        "Evaluate from 0 to 1: 1 minus one fifth = four fifths."
 Step 7: Multiply: 
        "Multiply: square root of 46 times 216 times four fifths = square root of 46 times 864 over 5."
        "So the result is the quantity 864 times the square root of 46, all over 5."

 But note: step 7 computation: 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, then times sqrt(46) -> so we can say:

        "Multiply: square root of 46 multiplied by 216 multiplied by four fifths equals the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity, over 5."

 However, in the scratchwork, we are to put only essential intermediate results. We should break it down.

 We can do:

        Step 7: "Compute the numerical factor: 216 times four fifths = 864 over 5."
        Step 8: "Then the result is: 864 over 5 times square root of 46, or the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity, over 5."

 But the instruction says: "Essential tracking only. Track only variables that change or are critical." We don't have changing variables? We have constants.

 Alternatively, we can combine step 7 and 8.

 We'll do:

        "The factor 216 times four fifths is 864 over 5, so the entire expression is square root of 46 times 864 over 5, which is the quantity 864 times the square root of 46, all over 5."

 However, to minimize, we can write:

        "Multiply: 216 * (4/5) = 864/5, so result = (864 sqrt(46)) / 5"

 But in TTS-ready:

        "Multiply: 216 times four fifths equals 864 over 5, so the result is the fraction: 864 times the square root of 46 over 5."

 But we want to avoid ambiguity? So we group:

        "Multiply: 216 times four fifths equals 864 over 5, so the result is the quantity: 864 times the square root of 46; end quantity, over 5."

 Now, we output the JSON.
