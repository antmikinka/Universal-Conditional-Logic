=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). Hmm, line integrals with respect to arc length. Right, the first step is to parameterize the curve C.

So, the line segment from point A (0,6,4) to point B (6,3,3). To parameterize, I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for a line segment is r(t) = A + t(B - A). Let's compute B - A: (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization should be r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), where t is from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds. For a line integral, ds is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, times dt. So first, compute dr/dt. The derivative of r(t) is (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of that vector is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [x(t)]³ z(t) * |dr/dt| dt. Let's substitute x(t) and z(t) from the parameterization. x(t) is 6t, so x³ is (6t)^3 = 216 t³. z(t) is 4 - t. So the integrand is 216 t³ (4 - t) * sqrt(46). Since sqrt(46) is a constant, I can factor that out.

So the integral is sqrt(46) * integral from 0 to 1 of 216 t³ (4 - t) dt. Let's expand the integrand: 216 [4t³ - t^4]. So the integral becomes 216 sqrt(46) * [4*(t^4/4) - t^5/5] from 0 to 1. Simplify inside the brackets: (t^4 - t^5/5) evaluated from 0 to 1. At t=1, that's 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. At t=0, it's 0. So the integral is 216 sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let's compute the integral step by step. The integral of 4t³ is 4*(t^4/4) = t^4, and the integral of -t^4 is -t^5/5. So combined, t^4 - t^5/5. Evaluated from 0 to1: (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5. Then multiply by 216 sqrt(46). So 216 * 4/5 = 864/5. So the final answer is (864/5) sqrt(46). Let me confirm the parameterization again. The direction vector is correct: from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so the components are 6, -3, -1. The derivative is correct. The magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46). Then substituting x and z: yes, x=6t, z=4-t. The integrand x³ z is (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Multiply by sqrt(46) dt. Integrate from 0 to1. So the integral is sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt. Which is sqrt(46)*216*( [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to1 ) = sqrt(46)*216*(1 -1/5) = sqrt(46)*216*(4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46). That seems right.

Now, converting this into TTS format. The main answer is 864 divided by 5 multiplied by square root of 46. So in TTS terms, "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six". But need to make sure to use "over" for the fraction. Wait, 864/5 is "eight hundred sixty-four over five". So the main answer would be "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

For the scratchwork, the key steps are parameterizing the line segment, computing ds, substituting into the integral, evaluating the integral. So the scratchwork values should be the essential steps. Let's see:

First step: parameterize C as r(t) equals 6t comma 6 minus 3t comma 4 minus t for t from zero to one.

Second step: ds equals square root of 46 dt.

Third step: integral becomes square root of 46 times integral from zero to one of (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) dt.

Fourth step: compute integral to get 864 over five square root of 46.

But the scratchwork should be in TTS-ready format, each step as a string. So maybe:

- "Parameterize C as the quantity six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t for t from zero to one"
- "Compute ds as square root of the quantity thirty-six plus nine plus one which equals square root of forty-six dt"
- "Substitute x equals six t and z equals four minus t into the integrand yielding two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t"
- "Integrate from zero to one to get eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

Wait, but the problem says "Essential scratchwork values: Put ONLY the essential calculation results in scratchwork_answer.values, NOT explanations". So maybe just the key numerical steps. Let me check the instructions. The scratchwork_answer should have values like ["key_step1", "key_step2", "key_result"].

The essential steps here would be the parameterization, the calculation of ds, the integral setup, and the final computation.

But per the instructions, "Scratchwork values: Put ONLY the essential calculation results in scratchwork_answer.values, NOT explanations". So perhaps the main intermediate results. For example:

- "r of t equals six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t"
- "ds equals square root of forty-six dt"
- "Integral equals square root of forty-six times two hundred sixteen times the integral from zero to one of four t cubed minus t to the fourth dt"
- "The integral evaluates to four fifths"

But need to convert these into TTS-ready phrases.

Wait, let's see the example given in the problem statement. For example 4, the scratchwork has entries like "For f(-1,2): Function f of the quantity negative one comma two end quantity equals negative nine plus four times one equals negative five". So they include the calculation steps.

In this case, the scratchwork should have the key steps as TTS phrases. Let's break it down:

1. Parameterization: "r of t equals the quantity zero plus six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t end quantity for t from zero to one"
But maybe simplified to "r of t equals six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t"

2. Compute |r'(t)|: "the magnitude of the derivative of r with respect to t is square root of forty-six"

3. The integral becomes: "square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity dt"

4. Expanding the integral: "two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times the quantity integral of four t cubed minus t to the fourth dt from zero to one"

5. Evaluating the integral: "the integral equals four fifths"

6. Final result: "two hundred sixteen times four fifths times square root of forty-six equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths square root of forty-six"

But according to the example, the scratchwork values are the key steps. Let's see example 4's scratchwork: "For f(-1,2): Function f of the quantity negative one comma two end quantity equals negative nine plus four times one equals negative five". So each entry is a step with the calculation.

So for this problem, the scratchwork would be:

- "Parameterize C as r of t equals six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t for t between zero and one"
- "Compute ds equals square root of forty-six dt"
- "The integral becomes square root of forty-six times integral from zero to one of two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity dt"
- "Evaluate the integral to get eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

But need to make sure each is a concise TTS phrase.

Alternatively, the essential steps might be:

- "r of t equals six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t"
- "ds equals square root of forty-six dt"
- "Integrand becomes two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity times square root of forty-six"
- "Integral from zero to one gives eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

Yes, these are the key steps. So the scratchwork_answer.values should be these four strings.

Now, the main answer is the final result: (864/5)√46, which in TTS is "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

Check the problem number: since it's the first problem here, but the user didn't specify, but in the problem statement it's just "1" perhaps. But the problem_number is to extract from the image. The image says "Evaluate the line integral... Where C is the line segment...", so it's a single problem. The problem_number should be "1".

Question type: open_ended.

Math_content_check: yes.

Main answer type is single_value.

So putting it all together.
