**Simplifying math expression**

I'm simplifying the expression 864 divided by 5 times the square root of 46. I could consider factoring as well. For the final answer, I need to use TTS-ready phrasing with specific quantity markers. So, I’ll use "the quantity" for the primary grouping and "end quantity" for more complex parts. There are guidelines about numbers needing to be spoken as words, but some examples used numerals. I'll decide to use words for consistency to follow the guidelines.**Clarifying number phrasing**

I'm looking at how I should phrase numbers, especially complex ones like 864 divided by 5 times the square root of forty-six. I want to use words for numbers, so for this expression, I might say: "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four divided by five, times square root of the quantity forty-six, end quantity." It’s essential to ensure I include "end quantity" to close off my groupings. The comma rules seem to suggest that I won't use them within my list of spoken numbers.**Organizing scratchwork parameters**

I need to ensure my scratchwork shows essential parameters like \( x \), \( r' \), the norm of the square root of forty-six, and the integrand for integral evaluation. I’ll focus on using TTS semantic language, which means spelling out numbers as words. For instance, when describing \( r(t) \), I'll say "vector r of t equals angle bracket six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t." Also, I need to maintain function notation, using "function f of the quantity negative one comma two end quantity equals" for clarity. I'll keep my tracking limited to key variables.**Specifying integral details**

I need to phrase division clearly, like saying "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four divided by five end quantity times square root of the quantity forty-six end quantity." I'll use "times" instead of a multiplication dot. I also have to ensure proper comma usage for coordinates when I specify endpoints. The problem statement should extract the integral problem, which is to evaluate \( \int_C x^3 z \, ds \), with C as the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). It must be formatted for TTS, so I'll include clear textual statements with the required syntax.**Building JSON structure**

I’m constructing the JSON format for the results. My main answer will be a singular TTS-ready string: "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four divided by five end quantity times square root of the quantity forty-six end quantity." I need to adhere to the guidelines for vectors and integrals, like saying "vector r of t equals vector six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t" for parameters, ensuring I use "comma" for coordinate separators. My scratchwork will track key calculations, including the integrand and steps for evaluation, using numbers spelled out as words throughout.**Crafting JSON for output**

I'm constructing the JSON containing the necessary components for my calculations. My entries will specify the parametrization, derivatives, and integral details. For the vector definition, I must include "comma" between components, like this: "vector r of t equals vector six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t for t from zero to one." I'll keep it concise, emphasizing essential steps like the integrand and final integral. Numbers will be spelled out, and I’ll ensure the strings are formatted correctly for valid JSON output.
