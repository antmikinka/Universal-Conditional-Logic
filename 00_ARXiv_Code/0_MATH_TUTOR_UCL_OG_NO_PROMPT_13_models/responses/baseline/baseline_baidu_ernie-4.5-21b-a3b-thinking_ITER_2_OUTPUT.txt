Got it, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem is to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I need to remember how to compute line integrals with respect to arc length (ds). 

First, I recall that for a line segment parameterization, we need a vector from the start to the end point, then parameterize it with a parameter t from 0 to 1. Let's start by finding the parametric equations for the curve C. The start point is P(0,6,4) and end point is Q(6,3,3). The direction vector is Q - P = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parametric equations will be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t (since starting at 0, moving 6 units in x direction as t goes from 0 to 1)
y(t) = 6 + (-3)t = 6 - 3t (starting at 6, moving -3 units in y per t)
z(t) = 4 + (-1)t = 4 - t (starting at 4, moving -1 unit in z per t)
where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Next, we need to find ds, which is the arc length element. To get ds, we first find dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, then compute the magnitude of the derivative vector and multiply by dt. Let's compute the derivatives:

dx/dt = d(6t)/dt = 6
dy/dt = d(6 - 3t)/dt = -3
dz/dt = d(4 - t)/dt = -1

Now, the speed is the magnitude of the derivative vector: √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²]. Let's calculate that:

(6)² + (-3)² + (-1)² = 36 + 9 + 1 = 46. So the speed is √46. Therefore, ds = √46 * dt. That's a constant, which is good because it simplifies things.

Now, the line integral ∫_C x³z ds becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [x(t)]³ * z(t) * ds. Substituting x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t, and ds = √46 dt:

∫₀¹ (6t)³ * (4 - t) * √46 dt. Let's simplify this step by step. First, (6t)³ is 216t³. Then multiply by (4 - t): 216t³(4 - t) = 216*(4t³ - t⁴) = 864t³ - 216t⁴. Then multiply by √46: the integral becomes √46 ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt.

Now, we can integrate term by term. Let's compute the integral of 864t³ - 216t⁴ from 0 to 1. The antiderivative of 864t³ is 864*(t⁴/4) = 216t⁴. The antiderivative of -216t⁴ is -216*(t⁵/5) = -43.2t⁵. So combining these, the antiderivative F(t) = 216t⁴ - 43.2t⁵.

Now evaluate F(1) - F(0). At t=1: 216*(1)⁴ - 43.2*(1)⁵ = 216 - 43.2 = 172.8. At t=0: 0 - 0 = 0. So the integral inside is 172.8. Then multiply by √46: 172.8 * √46. Wait, but maybe we should keep it in fractions for exactness. Let's redo the integration with fractions to be precise.

Original integral after substitution: √46 * ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt. Let's compute the integral:

∫864t³ dt = 864*(t⁴/4) = 216t⁴ (from 0 to 1: 216)
∫-216t⁴ dt = -216*(t⁵/5) = -43.2t⁵ (from 0 to 1: -43.2)
Wait, 216*(1)^4 is 216, and 216*(1)^5/5 is 216/5 = 43.2, so yes. So 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5 = 172.8. So that's 864/5. Then multiply by √46: (864/5)√46. Let's check if 864 can be simplified. 864 divided by 12 is 72, 72 divided by 12 is 6. 864 = 144*6, but maybe 864/5 is the simplest form. Alternatively, 864 = 16*54, but not sure. Anyway, the exact value is (864√46)/5. Let's confirm the steps again to make sure we didn't make a mistake.

Parametric equations: correct, x=6t, y=6-3t, z=4-t. Direction vector (6,-3,-1). Derivatives: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1. Speed: √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36+9+1)=√46. Correct, ds=√46 dt.

The integrand is x³z ds = (6t)^3*(4-t)*√46 dt = 216t³*(4-t)*√46 dt = √46*(216*(4t³ - t⁴)) dt = √46*(864t³ - 216t⁴) dt. Correct.

Integral from 0 to 1: √46*[864*(t⁴/4) - 216*(t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1. At t=1: 864*(1/4) = 216, 216*(1/5) = 216/5. So 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by √46: (864√46)/5. That's the exact value. Let's check if 864 and 5 have any common factors. 864 divided by 2 is 432, 5 is prime, so no, so that's simplified.

Now, the problem asks to evaluate the line integral, so the main answer is this value. Let's make sure we used the correct grouping and natural language. For the main answer, since it's a numerical value, we need to express it in TTS-ready format. The problem says to use natural language grouping with "quantity" markers. Wait, but the main answer is a value, so maybe just the expression? Wait, no, the examples show that for open-ended, the main answer is the calculated value. For example, Example 1 has "sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals 1" as the main answer. But in this case, the answer is a number (or a simplified expression). Let's see: the integral evaluates to (864√46)/5. Let's compute that numerically to check. √46 is approximately 6.7823, so 864*6.7823 ≈ 5860. 5860 /5 = 1172. So approximately 1172, but the exact value is (864√46)/5.

Now, for the JSON output. The problem type is open_ended (since it's an evaluation problem). The math_content_check is yes. The final_answers section: main_answer is a single_value, since there's one answer. The values array should contain the exact value. The answer_format is tts_ready, so we need to express it in natural language. Wait, but the examples for open-ended have values like ["3.5"] or ["2", "7"]. Wait, no, Example 4 has main_answer as blanks with values like ["f of the quantity negative one comma two end quantity equals negative five", etc.], but that's a fill-in-the-blank. For an open-ended problem that's evaluating to a single value, the main_answer would be a single_value with the exact expression. But the problem says "TTS-ready", so maybe we need to write the expression in words. Wait, the example 3 has main_answer as ["e raised to the power of the quantity x plus 1"], which is the expression. But in this case, the integral evaluates to a numerical value. Let's see: the problem says "evaluate the line integral", so the answer is a number. But how to express it in TTS-ready format. The requirement for TTS compatibility: use natural language grouping, so maybe write the expression as "the quantity 864 times square root of 46, all divided by 5". Because that's the exact value. Let's check the natural language grouping rules: for division, use "divided by". So "the quantity 864 times square root of 46, all divided by the quantity 5". That's TTS-ready.

Now, the scratchwork_answer should have the key steps. The key steps are: parametric equations x=6t, y=6-3t, z=4-t; derivative vector (6, -3, -1), speed √46; integrand (6t)^3*(4-t)*√46 dt; integrate from 0 to 1: (864/5)√46. But according to the quality control rules, scratchwork_answer should have essential intermediate results, and use TTS-ready language (full words, no symbols). So for scratchwork, we can write the steps in words. For example: "Parametric equations: x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t. Derivative vector: (6, -3, -1). Speed: square root of (6 squared plus (-3) squared plus (-1) squared) equals square root of 46. Integrand: (6t)^3 * (4 - t) * square root of 46 dt. Integral from 0 to 1: 864/5 times square root of 46." But wait, the scratchwork_answer's values need to be in TTS-ready format, so using full words. Also, according to the 10. SCRATCHWORK VALUES FORMATTING, each value should be a key step, and use natural flow with full words. So maybe:

"Parametric equations: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t. Derivative vector: (6, negative 3, negative 1). Speed: square root of (6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared) equals square root of 46. Integrand: (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) times square root of 46 dt. Integral from 0 to 1: 864 divided by 5 times square root of 46."

Now, putting it all together into the JSON structure. The problem_number is "1" (assuming this is part 1 of some section, but the input says "Problem 1|2a|2b|Part A|Part B|Section 1.1|etc.", but the user didn't specify, so maybe just use "1" as the problem_number). The problem_statement is "Evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)". Question_type is "open_ended". Math_content_check is "yes". Final_answers: main_answer type is "single_value", values array contains the TTS-ready expression: ["the quantity 864 times square root of 46, all divided by the quantity 5"], answer_format "tts_ready". Scratchwork_answer type is "multiple_values" (since there are multiple steps), values array contains the key steps in words as above.

Wait, but let's confirm the exact value again. Let's recalculate the integral step by step with fractions to be precise. The integral is √46 ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt. Let's compute the integral:

∫864t³ dt from 0 to 1 = 864 * [t⁴/4] from 0 to 1 = 864*(1/4) = 216.

∫-216t⁴ dt from 0 to 1 = -216 * [t⁵/5] from 0 to 1 = -216*(1/5) = -216/5.

So total integral inside is 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by √46: (864√46)/5. That's correct. So the exact value is (864√46)/5. To write this in TTS-ready format, using the natural language grouping rules for division: "the quantity 864 times square root of 46, all divided by the quantity 5". That's clear and follows the rules.

Now, the scratchwork_answer: the key steps are:

1. Parametric equations for C: x(t)=6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t, t∈[0,1].
2. Derivative vector: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1.
3. Speed: √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √46.
4. ds = √46 dt.
5. Integrand: x³z ds = (6t)³*(4-t)*√46 dt = 216t³(4-t)√46 dt = √46(864t³ - 216t⁴) dt.
6. Integrate from 0 to 1: √46 [864*(t⁴/4) - 216*(t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1 = √46 (216 - 216/5) = √46*(864/5) = (864√46)/5.

But according to the 9. ESSENTIAL TRACKING RULES, scratchwork_answer should have ONLY essential calculation results, no explanations. So the values in scratchwork_answer should be the key intermediate results. For example:

- "Parametric equations: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t"
- "Derivative vector: (6, negative 3, negative 1)"
- "Speed: square root of (6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared) equals square root of 46"
- "ds: square root of 46 times dt"
- "Integrand: (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) times square root of 46 dt"
- "Integral from 0 to 1 of integrand equals (864 divided by 5) times square root of 46"

But according to the 11. SCRATCHWORK VALUES FORMATTING, each value should be a key step, and use full words. Also, the 10. ANSWER TYPE HANDLING says for scratchwork_answer, values are key_step1, key_step2, etc., in TTS-ready format. So putting it all together, the scratchwork_answer values would be:

["Parametric equations: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t", "Derivative vector: (6, negative 3, negative 1)", "Speed: square root of (6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared) equals square root of 46", "ds: square root of 46 times dt", "Integrand: (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) times square root of 46 dt", "Integral from 0 to 1: (864 divided by 5) times square root of 46"]

But need to make sure that each value is a key step and TTS-ready. Also, the 9. ESSENTIAL TRACKING RULES say to use only essential grouping, mathematical operator precedence, etc. So this should be okay.

Now, putting all together into the JSON:

{
  "problem_number": "1",
  "problem_statement": "Evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)",
  "question_type": "open_ended",
  "math_content_check": "yes",
  "final_answers": {
    "main_answer": {

      "answer_format": "tts_ready"
    },
    "scratchwork_answer": {
      "values": [
        "Parametric equations: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t",
        "Derivative vector: (6, negative 3, negative 1)",
        "Speed: square root of (6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared) equals square root of 46",
        "ds: square root of 46 times dt",
        "Integrand: (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) times square root of 46 dt",
        "Integral from 0 to 1: (864 divided by 5) times square root of 46"
      ],
      "answer_format": "tts_ready"
    }
  }
}

Wait, but let's check if the main_answer is correct. The problem is to evaluate the line integral, so the main answer is the result of the integration, which is (864√46)/5. The TTS-ready format for that is "the quantity 864 times square root of 46, all divided by the quantity 5" because division uses "divided by" and the quantity markers are used for the numerator and denominator. That's correct.

Another check: the parametric equations are correct. The direction vector is (6, -3, -1), so x(t) = 0 + 6t, y(t) = 6 + (-3)t, z(t) = 4 + (-1)t. Correct.

The derivative vector is (6, -3, -1), so speed is √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √46. Correct.

ds = speed * dt = √46 dt. Correct.

The integrand is x³z ds = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) * √46 dt = 216t³(4 - t)√46 dt = √46(864t³ - 216t⁴) dt. Correct.

Integrating from 0 to 1: √46 [864*(t⁴/4) - 216*(t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1 = √46 (216 - 216/5) = √46*(864/5). Correct.

So the JSON should be as above.
