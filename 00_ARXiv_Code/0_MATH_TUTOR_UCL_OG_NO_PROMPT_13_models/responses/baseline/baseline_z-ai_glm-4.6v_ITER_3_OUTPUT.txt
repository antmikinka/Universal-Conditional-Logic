=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to solve this line integral problem. Let me analyze the problem:

The problem asks to evaluate the line integral:
∫_C x³z ds

Where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3).

To solve this, I need to:
1. Parameterize the line segment C
2. Compute ds in terms of the parameter
3. Substitute into the integral and evaluate

Let me parameterize the line segment from point A(0, 6, 4) to point B(6, 3, 3).

A parameterization can be:
r(t) = A + t(B - A) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t)

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So:
x = 6t
y = 6 - 3t  
z = 4 - t

Now I need to find ds:
ds = |r'(t)| dt

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
|r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

So ds = √46 dt

Now substitute into the integral:
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4 - t) √46 dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 216t³(4 - t) dt
= 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt
= 216√46 [4(t⁴/4) - (t⁵/5)]_0^1
= 216√46 [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1
= 216√46 [1 - 1/5]
= 216√46 × (4/5)
= 864√46/5

Let me double-check this calculation:
∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5

So the final answer is 864√46/5.

Let me format this according to the requirements:

The problem is about evaluating a line integral, which falls under the "multiple_integrals" question type.

For the JSON output, I need to:
1. Provide the problem statement
2. Specify the question type as "multiple_integrals"
3. Give the main answer in TTS-ready format
4. Include scratchwork with key steps

The main answer should be: "864 times square root of 46 over 5"

The scratchwork should include the key steps in TTS-ready format.
