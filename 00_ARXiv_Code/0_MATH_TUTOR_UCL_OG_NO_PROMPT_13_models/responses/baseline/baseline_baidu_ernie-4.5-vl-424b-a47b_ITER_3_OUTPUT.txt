=== REASONING / THINKING ===

We are given a line integral to evaluate: ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
Step 1: Parameterize the line segment.
Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
At t=0: (0,6,4)
At t=1: (6,3,3)
So, x(t) = 0 + (6-0)t = 6t
    y(t) = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t
    z(t) = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

Step 2: Compute the derivatives.
dx/dt = 6
dy/dt = -3
dz/dt = -1

Step 3: Compute the arc length differential ds.
ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt
   = sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) dt
   = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) dt
   = sqrt(46) dt

Step 4: Express the integrand in terms of t.
x³z = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴

Step 5: Set up the integral.
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_{t=0}^{1} (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt
            = sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt

Step 6: Compute the integral.
Let I = ∫_{0}^{1} (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt
   = [864*(t^4/4) - 216*(t^5/5)] from 0 to 1
   = [216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5] from 0 to 1
   = 216*(1) - (216/5)*(1) - 0
   = 216 - 43.2
   = 172.8

Alternatively, factor out 216:
   = 216 * [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1
   = 216 * [1 - 1/5] 
   = 216 * (4/5)
   = 864/5 = 172.8

Step 7: Multiply by sqrt(46).
Result = sqrt(46) * 172.8

We can leave it in exact form or compute numerically. But note that 172.8 = 864/5.
So, Result = (864/5) * sqrt(46) = (864 sqrt(46)) / 5

However, we can simplify 864/5? But 864 and 5 are coprime. So, we can write as (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

Alternatively, we can write as a decimal? But the problem might expect an exact answer.

Since the problem is an evaluation, we can compute the numerical value, but in math problems, exact form is often preferred.

But note: the instruction says to output in TTS format. We'll write the exact expression.

However, let's compute the numerical value for the scratchwork to verify? But in the final answer, we want TTS ready.

But the problem says: output as JSON. We are to provide TTS ready strings.

We have two options:
Option 1: (864/5) * sqrt(46) = (864 sqrt(46)) / 5
Option 2: We can write as (864/5) sqrt(46) but in TTS we might say "the quantity 864 over 5 times square root of 46".

Alternatively, we can compute the numerical value: 
sqrt(46) ≈ 6.782329983125268
Then 172.8 * 6.782329983125268 ≈ 1172.0 (let me calculate: 172.8 * 6.782329983125268 ≈ 1172.0? Actually, we did 864/5=172.8, then 172.8 * sqrt(46))

But let me compute: 172.8 * sqrt(46) ≈ 172.8 * 6.7823 ≈ 1172.0 (exactly: 172.8 * 6.7823 = let's compute: 172.8 * 6 = 1036.8, 172.8 * 0.7823 ≈ 135.1, total ≈ 1171.9). Actually, we can do exact.

But the problem doesn't specify. We can leave in exact form.

We'll write the exact form.

Step 8: Format for TTS.

For the main answer, we want: 
"the quantity 864 over 5 multiplied by square root of 46"

But note: we can also write as: (864 sqrt(46)) / 5 → "the quantity 864 square root of 46 over 5" or "864 over 5 times square root of 46"

I think: "the quantity 864 over 5 multiplied by square root of 46" is clear.

Alternatively, we can write as a fraction: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six"

But note: the scratchwork might show the steps. However, the problem only has one integral.

We'll assign:
problem_number: "1" (since it's the first problem in the image)
problem_statement: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x cubed z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)"
question_type: "open_ended" (since we are to compute a number)

Math content check: "yes"

Final answer: 
  main_answer: type "single_value", values: ["the quantity 864 over 5 multiplied by square root of 46"] or we can write the expression as a string for TTS.

But note: the example output uses the entire expression as a string. We are to output in TTS ready.

Alternatively, we can write: "eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by square root of forty-six"

But to be safe, we write the mathematical expression in words.

However, in the scratchwork, we can show the steps.

Scratchwork_answer:
We can break down the steps in TTS ready strings.

Step 1: Parameterize the curve: 
"Parameterization: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t"

Step 2: Compute derivatives:
"Derivative of x with respect to t equals 6, derivative of y with respect to t equals negative 3, derivative of z with respect to t equals negative 1"

Step 3: Compute ds:
"ds equals square root of the quantity 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared, end quantity dt, which equals square root of 46 dt"

Step 4: Express the integrand:
"The integrand x cubed z becomes the quantity 6t, quantity cubed, times the quantity 4 minus t, which equals 216 t cubed times 4 minus t, which is 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth"

Step 5: The integral becomes:
"The integral equals the integral from 0 to 1 of the quantity 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth, end quantity times square root of 46 dt"

Step 6: Factor out sqrt(46):
"Factor out square root of 46: square root of 46 times integral from 0 to 1 of 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth dt"

Step 7: Antiderivative:
"Antiderivative: 864 times t to the fourth over 4 minus 216 times t to the fifth over 5, which simplifies to 216 t to the fourth minus 43.2 t to the fifth"

Alternatively, in exact fractions:
"216 t to the fourth minus (216/5) t to the fifth"

Step 8: Evaluate from 0 to 1:
"At t=1: 216 minus 216/5 = 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5. At t=0: 0. So the integral equals 864/5"

Step 9: Multiply by sqrt(46):
"Multiply by square root of 46: the quantity 864 over 5 multiplied by square root of 46"

However, scratchwork_answer is an array of strings. We can break into key steps.

We'll do:

scratchwork_answer values:
["Parameterization: x equals 6t, y equals 6 minus 3t, z equals 4 minus t",
 "Derivatives: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1",
 "ds equals square root of 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared dt, which equals square root of 46 dt",
 "The integrand x cubed z becomes 216 t cubed times 4 minus t, which equals 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth",
 "The integral equals the integral from 0 to 1 of 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth dt, all multiplied by square root of 46",
 "Factor out square root of 46: square root of 46 times integral from 0 to 1 of 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth dt",
 "Antiderivative: 216 t to the fourth minus (216/5) t to the fifth",
 "Evaluate from 0 to 1: 216 minus 216/5 = 864/5",
 "Multiply by square root of 46: the quantity 864 over 5 multiplied by square root of 46"]

But note: in the last step, the integral of (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1 is 864/5, so then multiplied by sqrt(46).

Alternatively, we can combine the last two: "Result of the integral part is 864/5, then multiplied by square root of 46 gives the final answer."

We'll keep it as above.

But note: the scratchwork_answer is for essential intermediate results. We have included steps.

However, we can skip some steps? The instruction says "essential intermediate results". We are to show key results and substitutions.

But the instruction also says: "Only results needed for final answer" and "No formula derivations", but we are to show the calculation.

We'll show the key steps.

      ],

    }
  }
}

However, in the last scratchwork step, we have the same as the main answer. Alternatively, we can just state the result without repeating.

We'll adjust to avoid repetition.

Alternatively, we can write the scratchwork without the last step since the main answer is already that.

But the scratchwork should lead to the answer. We can end the scratchwork at "864 over 5", then the main answer is that times sqrt(46). But that might break the flow.

Alternatively, we can include the multiplication in the scratchwork and then the main answer is the same as the last step of scratchwork? But the main answer is independent.

But the instruction says: scratchwork_answer is for essential intermediate results. So we can show the calculation of the integral part (without the sqrt(46)) and then the main answer includes the sqrt(46). But that might be two different answers? No, the main answer is the entire expression.

We'll leave as above.

Alternatively, we can write the scratchwork to show the key numerical result of the integral (without the sqrt(46)) is 864/5, and then the main answer is that multiplied by sqrt(46). But then in the main answer we have to express that.

But the main answer is a single expression: (864/5)*sqrt(46). So we are safe.

We'll output the JSON as described.

Note: we must ensure that all mathematical symbols are converted to words.

Let me adjust the scratchwork to be more TTS friendly.

For example:
- "ds equals square root of 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared dt" → we can add "that is" for clarity? But we already have "which equals". Alternatively, we can write: "ds equals the square root of the quantity 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared, end quantity dt, that is square root of 46 dt"

But we already have that in the above.

We'll go with the above.
