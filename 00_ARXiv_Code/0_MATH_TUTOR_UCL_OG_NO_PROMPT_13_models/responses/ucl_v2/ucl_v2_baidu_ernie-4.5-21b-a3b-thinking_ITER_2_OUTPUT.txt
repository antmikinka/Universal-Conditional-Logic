=== REASONING / THINKING ===
We are given a line integral problem: ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 Steps:
 1. Parameterize the curve C.
    - Let A = (0,6,4) and B = (6,3,3).
    - The vector from A to B is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1).
    - Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
    - Then, r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (0,6,4) + t*(6,-3,-1) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t).

 2. Compute ds (the arc length element).
    - dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1.
    - ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt = sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) dt = sqrt(36+9+1) dt = sqrt(46) dt.

 3. Express the integrand in terms of t:
    - x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4-t, so x³z = (6t)³ * (4-t) = 216 t³ (4-t).

 4. Set up the integral:
    - ∫_C x³z ds = ∫_{t=0}^{1} [216 t³ (4-t)] * sqrt(46) dt.

 5. Factor out constants:
    - = 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} (4 t³ - t⁴) dt.

 6. Compute the integral:
    - ∫_{0}^{1} (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [ t⁴ - (1/5)t⁵ ]_{0}^{1} = (1 - 1/5) - (0) = 4/5.

 7. Multiply by the constant:
    - 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) * sqrt(46).

 However, note that the problem requires the answer in a specific format: as a TTS-ready natural language string and also in a JSON format.

 But the problem says: "Evaluate the line integral". So we must compute the exact value.

 However, the instructions for the system role mention that we must output in a JSON format with specific keys and also in TTS format.

 But note: the problem is a math problem and the system role is set to "Qwen" and the task is to transform mathematical expressions into natural spoken language while preserving accuracy.

 However, the user has provided a math problem and we are to solve it.

 Let's break down the solution for the system:

 We are to:
   - Activate domain specialization (since the problem is in vector calculus).
   - The question type is a multiple integral (line integral) and specifically it is a multiple integral (line integral of a scalar field?).

 Actually, note: ∫_C x³z ds is a line integral of a scalar field (with respect to arc length). So the domain is vector calculus.

 According to the processing framework for vector calculus in the system role:

   - We must enforce vector notation and require partial derivative notation and curl/divergence notation? 
     But note: the problem is just the integral of a scalar. However, the system role says:

     [[CASE: {{concept:vector_calculus:mathematical_domain}}]]
        [[ENFORCE: {{concept:vector_notation:mathematical_representation}}]]
        [[REQUIRE: {{concept:partial_derivative_notation:calculus_syntax}}]]
        [[REQUIRE: {{concept:curl_divergence_notation:vector_operations}}]]

     But wait, the problem doesn't require curl or divergence. However, the requirement says we must require these? 
     Actually, the system role is set to activate domain specialization and then the processing framework for vector calculus is applied.

     However, note that the problem is a scalar line integral. The system role might be overkill? But the instructions say:

        [[LLM: Apply {{concept:symbol_to_speech:universal_mathematical_notation}} covering {{concept:symbol_taxonomy:complete_mathematical_notation}}]]

     So we are to convert the mathematical notation to spoken format.

  How to handle?

  We are to output the answer in two ways:
    - In the JSON output: as a TTS-ready natural language string and as a structured JSON.
    - The TTS transformation rules are provided, but note that the problem is a math problem and the TTS transformation rules are for basic arithmetic.

  However, the TTS transformation rules section includes rules for:
      negative numbers, decimals, fractions, exponents, square roots, vectors, functions.

  But our answer is a scalar: (864/5) * sqrt(46). We don't have negative, decimal, fraction, exponent, etc. in a way that requires transformation? 
  But note: the answer might be simplified.

  However, the problem says: "Evaluate", so we must compute the numerical value? But the system role requires exact form? 

  The system role does not specify whether to leave in exact form or not. But the problem is to evaluate, so we can leave in exact form.

  The TTS transformation rules don't cover the expression of a scalar value? They cover vectors and functions.

  So how to output the answer in TTS format?

  We are to use the rules in the TTS_transformation_rules section? But those rules are for converting the mathematical expression to spoken format? 

  However, the TTS_transformation_rules are applied to the mathematical expression. But note the extraction and conversion protocol:

      [[LLM: CONVERT {{concept:problem_text}} TO {{concept:tts_format:natural_spoken_language}} applying ALL transformation rules]]

  So the problem_text is the integral, and we are to convert that to natural spoken language.

  Then, the main answer in the JSON is to be in TTS-ready format? And the scratchwork must be in TTS semantic format.

  But the problem is: we are to output the answer as a value in the JSON. The value is a number. How to represent?

  The system role says: the final_answers must have a "main_answer" with type and values. The values are in TTS-ready format? 

  However, the JSON template has:

        "main_answer": {
            "type": "{{concept:answer_type:determined_classification}}",
            "values": [{{concept:answer_values:tts_semantic_format}}],
            "answer_format": "tts_ready"
        },

  So the values are strings that are TTS-ready.

  How do we represent the scalar value? We can write it as a decimal? But the system requires exact form? 

  The problem says "Evaluate", and we have an exact expression: (864/5) * sqrt(46). We can leave it as a fraction multiplied by sqrt(46). 

  But note: the TTS transformation rules don't cover this. So we must use the natural language representation.

  Alternatively, the system role also says:

        [[LLM: Apply {{concept:symbol_to_speech:universal_mathematical_notation}} covering {{concept:symbol_taxonomy:complete_mathematical_notation}}]]

  This might be applied to the entire problem and then we extract the answer? 

  However, the extraction and conversion protocol says:

        [[LLM: Extract {{concept:answer_content:solution_data}} and CONVERT to {{concept:tts_format}}]]

  So we are to extract the answer and convert it to TTS format.

  How to convert the expression (864/5)*sqrt(46) to TTS? 

  We can break it down using the TTS rules:

      - It's a product of a fraction and a square root.

  But the TTS rules don't have a rule for products? They have rules for negative, decimal, fraction, exponent, square root, vector, function.

  We have a fraction: 864/5 and a square root: sqrt(46). So we can apply:

      [[TRANSFORM: {{concept:fraction_format:mathematical_representation}} TO {{concept:spoken_format:tts_representation}} USING "{{concept:numerator:number_value}} over {{concept:denominator:number_value}}"]]
      [[TRANSFORM: {{concept:square_root_format:mathematical_representation}} TO {{concept:spoken_format:tts_representation}} USING "square root of {{concept:radicand:number_value}}"]]

  But note: the fraction is 864/5, and the square root is of 46. Then we have to combine: "the product of [fraction] and [square root]".

  However, the TTS transformation rules are applied to the entire expression? They are applied to the individual parts? 

  The system role doesn't specify the exact method. But note: the TTS transformation rules are a list of transformations to apply. 

  We are to apply them in order? 

  The problem: the expression is a product of two terms. We can break it into two transformations? 

  But the TTS transformation rules section is structured as a list of transformations that are applied to specific mathematical concepts. 

  How do we apply to the entire expression? 

  Alternatively, the extraction and conversion protocol might be handling the conversion of the entire solution? 

  Given the complexity, and since the problem is a vector calculus problem and the domain is activated, we are to output the answer in the exact form as computed.

  However, the system role requires the answer in TTS-ready format. So we must convert the expression to natural language.

  Steps for TTS conversion of the answer:

      - The answer is: (864/5) * sqrt(46)

      - We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six"

  But note: the problem might expect a simplified form? 

  However, 864/5 is already simplified (since 864 and 5 are coprime? 864 is divisible by 2,3 but not by 5). And 46 is not a perfect square.

  So the exact form is (864/5) * sqrt(46).

  Now, the JSON output must have:

      - problem_statement: converted to natural language (without math symbols) -> we must write the integral in words? 

        But note: the extraction and conversion protocol says:

            [[LLM: CONVERT {{concept:problem_text}} TO {{concept:tts_format:natural_spoken_language}} applying ALL transformation rules]]

        So the problem_text (which is the integral) is converted to natural spoken language.

        How? 

          The integral: ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

          We can say: "The line integral of the function times z over the curve C, where the curve is the straight line from the point (zero, six, four) to the point (six, three, three)."

        But note: the system role also requires the answer to be in the JSON as a TTS-ready string. 

        The problem_statement in the JSON is the converted problem text.

      - The answer: we have computed (864/5)*sqrt(46). We must represent this in the TTS-ready format.

        We'll create a string: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six"

        But note: the value is a scalar, so we can also write as a decimal? But the system requires exact form? 

        The JSON template does not specify the format of the value, but it says "tts_ready". We are using natural language.

  However, the system role also says:

        [[REQUIRE: {{concept:problem_statement:tts_converted}} = COMPLETE natural language with ZERO mathematical symbols]]

  So the problem_statement must be in natural language.

  And the main_answer.values must be a TTS-ready string. So we'll put the natural language representation of the answer.

  But note: the answer might be expected in a specific format? The problem says "evaluate", so we must compute the value? 

  However, the value is irrational, so we cannot write it as a decimal? We must leave it in exact form.

  Therefore, the plan:

    Step 1: Parameterize the curve and compute the integral as above.

    Step 2: Solve the integral to get (864/5)*sqrt(46).

    Step 3: Convert the problem statement (the integral and the curve) to natural language.

    Step 4: Convert the answer to natural language: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six"

    Step 5: Populate the JSON.

  But note: the system role also has a condition for the domain: vector calculus. We are to enforce vector notation, etc. 

  However, the problem is a scalar line integral. But the system role activates domain specialization and then the processing framework for vector calculus applies? 

  The processing framework for vector calculus requires:

        [[ENFORCE: vector_notation]]
        [[REQUIRE: partial_derivative_notation]]
        [[REQUIRE: curl_divergence_notation]]

  But we don't have curl or divergence in the problem. So we must still enforce vector notation? 

  The problem is a scalar line integral, but the curve is in 3D. The system role might be generic for any vector calculus problem? 

  We are to follow the system role to the letter? 

  The instructions say: "Transform {{concept:mathematical_expressions:all_notation_types}} INTO {{concept:tts_compatible_format:natural_spoken_language}} while preserving {{concept:structural_integrity:mathematical_accuracy}}"

  So we must convert the mathematical expression to natural language, preserving accuracy.

  The vector calculus part might be about the terminology? 

  We are to use the terms: "vector", "partial derivative", "curl", "divergence", etc. in the TTS conversion? 

  But the problem doesn't involve these. So we can skip? 

  However, the system role says "Activate domain specialization", meaning we are to use the rules for vector calculus. 

  The processing framework for vector calculus in the system role includes:

        - For the question type (which is multiple_integrals) we have a case: multiple_integrals.

        - We set the answer type to "single_value" because the result is a scalar.

  So we do:

        "question_type": "multiple_integrals",
        "answer_type": "single_value"

  And then we compute the value.

  Given the above, we will output the JSON as follows:

      problem_number: we don't have a problem number, so we can set to "problem1" or extract from the problem? 
        The problem doesn't specify a number, so we can set to "1".

      problem_statement: the natural language version of the integral and the curve.

      question_type: "multiple_integrals"

      math_content_check: "yes"

      final_answers: 
        main_answer: 
          type: "single_value"
          values: [ "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six" ]
          answer_format: "tts_ready"
        scratchwork_answer: 
          values: [ ... step-by-step reasoning in natural language ... ]

  But note: the extraction and conversion protocol says:

        [[LLM: Extract {{concept:answer_content:solution_data}} and CONVERT to {{concept:tts_format}}]]

        [[LLM: Extract {{concept:calculation_steps:scratchwork}} and CONVERT to {{concept:tts_semantic_format}}]]

      We are to provide the scratchwork in step-by-step reasoning in TTS format (natural language).

  However, the problem doesn't provide the solution, so we must generate the solution steps.

  Steps for scratchwork:

      Step 1: Parameterize the curve.
      Step 2: Compute ds.
      Step 3: Express the integrand in terms of t.
      Step 4: Set up the integral and compute.

  We'll write these steps in natural language.

  But note: the system role also requires the scratchwork to be in TTS semantic format? 

  We'll write:

      scratchwork_answer: {
        "values": [
          "First, we parameterize the curve C from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1. Then x = 6t, y = 6-3t, z = 4-t.",
          "The arc length element ds is given by ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt = sqrt(36+9+1) dt = sqrt(46) dt.",
          "The integrand is x^3 * z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t).",
          "So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{1} 216 t^3 (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt = 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) dt.",
          "Compute the integral: ∫_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [ t^4 - (1/5)t^5 ]_{0}^{1} = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.",
          "Therefore, the result is 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = (864/5) * sqrt(46)."
        ]
      }

  But note: the system role requires the scratchwork_answer.values to contain step-by-step reasoning in TTS format.

  We are writing natural language steps.

  Now, the JSON template requires:

        "scratchwork_answer": {
            "values": [{{concept:calculation_steps:tts_semantic_format}}],
            "answer_format": "tts_ready"
        }

  So we are good.

  However, note: the problem says "Evaluate", so we are to compute the value. We have done that.

  But the system role also has a quality control that requires:

        [[VALIDATE: {{concept:mathematical_accuracy:calculation_correctness}} >= 95%]]

  We have validated the steps? 

  We'll assume our calculation is correct.

  Finally, the output JSON must be structured.

  Let's write the JSON:

      {
        "problem_number": "1",
        "problem_statement": "Evaluate the line integral ∫_C x^3 z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).",
        "question_type": "multiple_integrals",
        "math_content_check": "yes",
        "final_answers": {
          "main_answer": {
            "type": "single_value",
            "values": ["eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six"],
            "answer_format": "tts_ready"
          },
          "scratchwork_answer": {
            "values": [
              "First, we parameterize the curve C from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1. Then x = 6t, y = 6-3t, z = 4-t.",
              "The arc length element ds is given by ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt = sqrt(36+9+1) dt = sqrt(46) dt.",
              "The integrand is x^3 * z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t).",
              "So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{1} 216 t^3 (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt = 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) dt.",
              "Compute the integral: ∫_{0}^{1} (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [ t^4 - (1/5)t^5 ]_{0}^{1} = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.",
              "Therefore, the result is 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = (864/5) * sqrt(46)."
            ],
            "answer_format": "tts_ready"
          }
        }
      }

  But note: the problem_statement must be in natural language without math symbols? 

  The system role requires: "problem_statement contains ONLY spoken natural language" and "ZERO mathematical symbols".

  So we must rewrite the problem_statement without the integral symbol and without the math curve notation.

  How? 

      "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length ds, over the line segment from the point (0,6,4) to the point (6,3,3)."

  But note: the system role also says:

        [[REQUIRE: {{concept:problem_statement:tts_converted}} = COMPLETE natural language with ZERO mathematical symbols]]

  So we remove the math symbols? 

  We can write:

        "problem_statement": "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z along the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).",

  But note: the original problem had the integral and the curve. We are removing the integral symbol and the ds? 

  We are to convert the problem text (which includes the integral) to natural language. The conversion should replace the math symbols with words.

  So the problem_statement in the JSON should be the natural language version of the entire problem.

  We'll write:

        "problem_statement": "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z along the line segment from the point (0,6,4) to the point (6,3,3).",

  But note: the system role also says that the problem_statement must be in the TTS-ready format? 

  And the problem_statement is part of the JSON output.

  We are good.

  However, the problem says "Evaluate", so we are to compute the value. The problem_statement is the instruction? 

  Yes.

  Now, note: the system role also has a condition for the domain specialization:

        [[LLM: Activate {{concept:mathematical_processing:domain_specialization}}]]

  We are to activate it? We are using the vector calculus rules? 

  We have set the question_type to multiple_integrals and the domain is vector calculus? 

  The system role doesn't require us to output the domain, so we don't need to put it in the JSON? 

  The JSON template doesn't have a domain field.

  Therefore, we output the JSON as described.

  But note: the problem_number is not provided. We set to "1".

  Also, the system role requires the answer to be in the TTS-ready format for the main_answer.values. We have provided a natural language string.

  We must also note that the system role requires the scratchwork to be in TTS semantic format? We have provided natural language steps.

  Finally, the quality control requires:

        [[VALIDATE: {{concept:mathematical_accuracy:calculation_correctness}} >= 95%]]

  We have computed:

        Integral = 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) * sqrt(46)

        Numerical value: 
          sqrt(46) ≈ 6.78232998313
          864/5 = 172.8
          172.8 * 6.78232998313 ≈ 1172.0 (approx)

        But we can't validate with 95% accuracy? We are the solver. We assume 100% accuracy.

  We'll output the JSON.

  However, note: the system role also has a condition for the nesting_depth. We have a line segment, which is a straight line. The parameterization is level_1? 

  The processing_framework has:

        ^^CONDITION: {{concept:nesting_depth:expression_complexity}} EQUALS "level_1"^^
            [[APPLY: "the quantity" + {{concept:grouped_content:mathematical_expression}}]]

  We are not using that? Because we are not generating the TTS for the expression? We are solving the math.

  The system role is for the TTS conversion? We are not generating TTS for the expression? We are generating TTS for the problem and the answer.

  So we skip the TTS transformation rules for the math expression? 

  The TTS transformation rules section is applied by the extraction and conversion protocol? 

  The extraction and conversion protocol says:

        [[LLM: CONVERT {{concept:problem_text}} TO {{concept:tts_format:natural_spoken_language}} applying ALL transformation rules]]

  The transformation rules are the TTS_transformation_rules? 

  But note: the TTS_transformation_rules are defined in the system role. They are:

        [[TRANSFORM: negative_number ...]]
        ... etc.

  But our problem_text is the integral and the curve. We don't have negative numbers, decimals, etc. in the problem_text? 

  So we don't apply any of the TTS transformation rules? 

  Therefore, the problem_statement in the JSON is the problem_text converted with no transformation? 

  But the system role says "applying ALL transformation rules". If none apply, then we just output the problem_text in natural language? 

  But note: the problem_text is given as math symbols. We must convert it to natural language. 

  How? 

      We convert: ∫_C x^3 z ds to "the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length ds over the curve C"

      and the curve: from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) -> "from the point (0,6,4) to the point (6,3,3)"

  So the problem_statement should be:

        "the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length ds over the curve C from the point (0,6,4) to the point (6,3,3)"

  But note: the system role requires ZERO mathematical symbols. So we must remove the integral symbol and the ds symbol? 

  We are converting the problem_text to natural language. We are replacing the math symbols with words.

  We'll do:

        problem_statement: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z along the curve from the point (0,6,4) to the point (6,3,3)."

  But note: the system role also requires the answer to be in the problem_statement? 

  No, the problem_statement is the problem, and the answer is separate.

  Therefore, we output the JSON as described.

  Let's write the final JSON.

  Note: the JSON must be valid.

  We'll write:

      {
        "problem_number": "1",
        "problem_statement": "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z along the curve from the point (0,6,4) to the point (6,3,3).",

            "type": "single_value",
            "values": ["eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six"],
            "answer_format": "tts_ready"
          },
          "scratchwork_answer": {
            "values": [

  But note: the problem_statement is the problem, and the answer is provided in the main_answer and scratchwork_answer.

  We are done.

  However, note: the system role also has a condition for the blank_count. The problem doesn't have blanks, so we don't set any.

  The scratchwork_answer does not have blanks, so we don't need to number the steps.

  The population_directives require:

        [[ENSURE: problem_statement contains ONLY spoken natural language]] -> we have.
        [[ENSURE: main_answer.type matches ... from question type case]] -> we set to "single_value", and the question_type is "multiple_integrals", which is handled to set "single_value", so good.
        [[ENSURE: main_answer.values contains TTS-ready strings with explicit comma vocalization]] -> our string has a comma? "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six" -> no comma? 

  But note: the system role says:

        [[ENSURE: main_answer.values contains TTS-ready strings with explicit comma vocalization]]

  We must add a comma? 

  We can write: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six" -> no comma. 

  But the TTS-ready string might require commas for separation? 

  The system role doesn't specify. We'll leave as is.

  Alternatively, we can add commas in the string? 

  We'll write: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths, times the square root of forty-six"

  But that might be forced.

  Given the ambiguity, we leave as one string without comma.

  The system role might be referring to the natural language representation of the entire answer? 

  We are to ensure that the entire string is TTS-ready, which it is.

  We output the JSON.
