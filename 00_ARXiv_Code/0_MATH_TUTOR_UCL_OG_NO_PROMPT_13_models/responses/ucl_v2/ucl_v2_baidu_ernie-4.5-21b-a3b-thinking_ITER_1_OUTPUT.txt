=== REASONING / THINKING ===
We are given a line integral problem: ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 Steps:
 1. Parameterize the curve C.
    - Let A = (0,6,4) and B = (6,3,3).
    - The vector from A to B is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1).
    - Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
    - Then, r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t in [0,1].

 2. Find dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt.
    - dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1.

 3. The arc length element ds is given by:
    - ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt
    - Compute: 
        (dx/dt)^2 = 36
        (dy/dt)^2 = 9
        (dz/dt)^2 = 1
        So, ds = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)   [constant]

 4. The integral becomes:
    ∫_{t=0}^{1} [x(t)]^3 * z(t) * ds 
    But note: ds = sqrt(46) dt, so we factor out the constant sqrt(46).

    So, integral = sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} [ (6t)^3 * (4-t) ] dt

 5. Compute the integral:
    Let I = ∫_{0}^{1} (6t)^3 * (4-t) dt = ∫_{0}^{1} 216 t^3 (4-t) dt
    = 216 * ∫_{0}^{1} (4 t^3 - t^4) dt

    Now, integrate term by term:
      ∫ 4 t^3 dt = 4 * (t^4/4) = t^4
      ∫ -t^4 dt = - (t^5/5)

    So, ∫ (4 t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1.

    At t=1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5
    At t=0: 0

    Therefore, I = 216 * (4/5) = 216 * 0.8 = 172.8

    But let's compute exactly:
        I = 216 * (4/5) = 864/5 = 172.8

 6. Multiply by sqrt(46):
    Total = sqrt(46) * (864/5) = (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5

 However, note: the problem asks for the final answer in a boxed format.

 But wait: let me double-check the steps.

 Alternatively, we can write the integral as:
    ∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 [ (6t)^3 * (4-t) ] * sqrt(46) dt
               = sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt
               = sqrt(46) * 216 * [ (t^4 - t^5/5) ]_0^1
               = sqrt(46) * 216 * (1 - 1/5)
               = sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5)
               = sqrt(46) * (864/5)

 So, the exact value is (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 We can leave it like that, or compute a decimal? But the problem does not specify.

 However, note: the problem is to evaluate the integral, so we can leave it in exact form.

 But let me check the computation of the integral:

    ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

    Then 216 * (4/5) = 864/5.

    Then multiply by sqrt(46): (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 Therefore, the final answer is (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 However, we can simplify: 864 and 5 have no common factors (5 is prime, 864 is divisible by 2 and 3 but not by 5). So it's already simplified.

 But note: the problem says "Evaluate", so we can write it as a single expression.

 Alternatively, we can write it as 172.8 * sqrt(46) but exact form is better.

 Let me check the parameterization: 
    At t=0: (0,6,4) -> correct.
    At t=1: (6,3,3) -> correct.

 And the speed: |dr/dt| = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46) -> correct.

 So, the answer is: (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 But note: the problem might expect a numerical value? However, the integral involves a square root and the problem is mathematical, so exact form is acceptable.

 However, the instruction says: "output the final answer within \boxed{}".

 We'll box the exact expression.

 But wait: let me compute the integral again to be sure.

    x(t)=6t, z(t)=4-t
    x^3 = (6t)^3 = 216 t^3
    So, 216 t^3 * (4-t) = 216*(4 t^3 - t^4) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.

    Integrate: 
        ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt 
        = 864 * [t^4/4]_0^1 - 216 * [t^5/5]_0^1
        = 864 * (1/4) - 216 * (1/5)
        = 216 - 43.2
        = 172.8

    Then multiply by sqrt(46): 172.8 * sqrt(46) = (864/5) * sqrt(46)

 So, same as above.

 Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}

 However, note that the problem is a line integral and we have computed it exactly.

 But let me see if we can write it differently? 864/5 = 172.8, but that's not exact. So we keep the fraction.

 Alternatively, we can write it as \boxed{\frac{864}{5}\sqrt{46}}.

 But the boxed format should be a single expression.

 Since 864 and 5 are coprime, we can write it as \boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}.

 However, note: the problem says "Evaluate", and we have an exact expression.

 So, we output:

 \boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}

 But wait: the problem says "Where: C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)". We have done that.

 However, let me check the direction: the parameterization from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) is correct.

 Also, note that the integral is with respect to arc length, so the direction doesn't matter (because we use ds, which is positive).

 Therefore, the answer is correct.


==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
The line integral to evaluate is \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\), where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\).

### Step 1: Parameterize the Curve
The vector from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\) is \(\langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle\). Let \(t\) range from 0 to 1:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t \rangle.
\]
Thus, \(x(t) = 6t\), \(y(t) = 6 - 3t\), \(z(t) = 4 - t\).

### Step 2: Compute the Differential Arc Length \(ds\)
The derivatives are:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 6, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = -3, \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = -1.
\]
The speed is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}.
\]
So, \(ds = \sqrt{46}  dt\).

### Step 3: Substitute into the Integral
The integral becomes:
\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_0^1 (6t)^3 (4 - t) \cdot \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216t^3 (4 - t)  dt.
\]
Simplify the integrand:
\[
216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4.
\]
So:
\[
\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Integral
Compute the antiderivative:
\[
\int (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt = 864 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} = 216t^4 - \frac{216}{5}t^5.
\]
Evaluate from 0 to 1:
\[
\left[ 216(1)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(1)^5 \right] - \left[ 216(0)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(0)^5 \right] = 216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{1080}{5} - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{864}{5}.
\]
Multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\):
\[
\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}.
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
\]
