=== REASONING / THINKING ===

We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 Steps:
 1. Parameterize the curve C.
 2. Compute the derivatives of the parameterization to get the velocity vector.
 3. Find the magnitude of the velocity vector (speed) to compute ds.
 4. Substitute the parameterization into the integrand.
 5. Evaluate the integral over the parameter interval.

 Step 1: Parameterization
 Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
 x(t) = 0 + (6-0)t = 6t
 y(t) = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t
 z(t) = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

 Step 2: Velocity vector
 dx/dt = 6
 dy/dt = -3
 dz/dt = -1

 Step 3: Speed
 ds/dt = sqrt( (dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)² ) = sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)
 Therefore, ds = sqrt(46) dt

 Step 4: Integrand in terms of t
 x³ z = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴

 Step 5: Integral
 ∫_C x³ z ds = ∫_{t=0}^{1} (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt
 = sqrt(46) * ∫_0^1 (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt

 Compute the integral:
 ∫ (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt = 864 * (t^4/4) - 216 * (t^5/5) evaluated from 0 to 1
 = [216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5] from 0 to 1
 = 216(1)^4 - (216/5)(1)^5 - 0
 = 216 - 216/5
 = (1080 - 216)/5
 = 864/5

 Therefore, the integral is sqrt(46) * (864/5)

 But let's compute the numerical value or leave in simplified form?
 We can leave it as: (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5

 However, we can simplify 864/5? It's already in fraction.

 Alternatively, we can factor out common factors? But 864 and 5 are coprime? Actually, 864 and 5 have no common factors.

 So the answer is: (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5

 Let me double-check the integrand substitution and the integral calculation.

 Alternatively, we can compute the integral step-by-step:

 ∫_0^1 864 t³ dt = 864 * [t^4/4]_0^1 = 864 * (1/4) = 216
 ∫_0^1 216 t⁴ dt = 216 * [t^5/5]_0^1 = 216/5

 But note: the integrand is 864 t³ - 216 t⁴, so:

 ∫ (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5   [This is the same as above]

 Then multiply by sqrt(46): (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5

 We can simplify 864/5? Not really, but we can write it as a decimal if needed? However, the problem doesn't specify.

 Alternatively, we can factor 864: 864 = 864, so the expression is (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 But let me check the calculation of the speed again: 
   sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46) -> correct.

 The integrand: x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 * (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 -> correct.

 Now the integral of 864 t^3 from 0 to 1: 864 * (1/4) = 216.
 The integral of -216 t^4 from 0 to 1: -216 * (1/5) = -216/5.
 So total: 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5 -> correct.

 Therefore, the line integral is (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 We can write it as (864 sqrt(46)) / 5 or simplify the fraction? 864 and 5 are coprime, so that's the simplified form.

 Alternatively, we can factor out 216? But it's already simple.

 Let me compute a numerical value to check? 
   sqrt(46) ≈ 6.78232998
   864 * 6.78232998 ≈ 5859.94
   divided by 5: 1171.988

 But we don't need a numerical value unless specified.

 So the final answer is (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 But wait, the problem says "Evaluate the line integral", and in the context, we might leave it in exact form.

 However, note that we can factor the constant? 864/5 is 172.8 times sqrt(46) but that's not simpler.

 Alternatively, we can write it as (864/5) * sqrt(46). 

 I think that's acceptable.

 However, let me see if we can reduce 864 and 5? They have no common factors, so it's fine.

 Final Answer: \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

 But wait, let me check the integral again: 
   The integral of (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1 is indeed 216 - 216/5 = 864/5.

 Then multiplied by sqrt(46). So yes.

 However, note that 864/5 is the same as 172.8, but we leave it as fraction.

 So the boxed answer is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

 But let me see if the problem expects a simplified radical or something? I think that's simplified.

 Alternatively, we can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, same thing.

 Therefore, the final answer is \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}.
