=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). Hmm, line integrals of scalar functions... I remember that for a scalar function, the line integral is calculated by parameterizing the curve, then integrating the function over the parameter with respect to the arc length element ds.

First, I need to parameterize the line segment C. A line segment between two points can be parameterized using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. Let's denote the starting point as P = (0,6,4) and the ending point as Q = (6,3,3). The vector from P to Q is Q - P = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parametric equations for the line segment should be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds, which is the differential arc length. For a parameterized curve r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), ds is |r'(t)| dt. So let's compute the derivative of the parameterization.

r'(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x(t), z(t), and ds into the integral. The function to integrate is x³z. Let's express x and z in terms of t:

x(t) = 6t, so x³ = (6t)³ = 216t³

z(t) = 4 - t

Therefore, the integrand becomes 216t³ * (4 - t) * sqrt(46)

So the integral from t=0 to t=1 is:

∫₀¹ [216t³(4 - t)] * sqrt(46) dt

Let's factor out the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ t³(4 - t) dt

First compute the integral ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt

Integrate term by term:

∫4t³ dt = 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴

∫t⁴ dt = t⁵/5

So the integral from 0 to 1 is [t⁴ - t⁵/5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5

Therefore, the total integral is 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46)

Wait, let me check the arithmetic. 216 * 4 = 864, yes. So 864/5 sqrt(46). That's the result.

Let me verify each step again to make sure.

Parameterization: correct, since at t=0, (0,6,4); t=1, (6,3,3). Derivatives are 6, -3, -1. Magnitude squared is 36 + 9 +1=46, so sqrt(46). Correct.

x³z = (6t)^3*(4 - t) = 216t³(4 - t). Correct.

Integral of 4t³ - t⁴ from 0 to1: [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to1 is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

Multiply by 216*sqrt(46): 216*(4/5) = 864/5. So the result is (864/5)√46.

Yes, that seems right.
