**Formatting mathematical values for TTS**

I’m considering how to format values for text-to-speech (TTS) without using mathematical symbols. I need to express fractions and square roots in a way that’s clear. For instance, I could say “eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six.” I also have to remember to include explicit comma vocalization, especially in longer phrases, while ensuring that TTS strings follow the right structure without unnecessary phrases like “the value is” at the beginning.**Restating TTS problem statement**

I need to convert the problem statement into natural language for TTS. I should rephrase it to say, “Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length along curve C, where C is the line segment from the ordered triple zero, six, four to six, three, three.” I have to avoid using parentheses and any symbols. Instead of using "point," I might stick with "from the ordered triple," as it sounds clearer and aligns with the output specifications.**Planning the TTS mapping for line integrals**

I need to use "x cubed" for x^3 and "times" for multiplication in my TTS mapping. For "ds," I can say "with respect to arc length." It’s essential to present my reasoning step-by-step in a clear TTS format, including explicit comma statements. I'll evaluate complexity and nesting level while ensuring JSON validity without any math symbols. My answer should include steps like "x is six t, y is six minus three t," and reference operations appropriately, all while keeping it concise and user-friendly.**Refining expressions for TTS**

I want to use "to" instead of equals to enhance clarity. For fraction conversion, I'll phrase it as "eight hundred sixty-four over five" instead of "864/5" and say "square root of forty-six" for square roots. It’s also important to compute intermediate steps, such as the dot products and the norm of the vector (6, -3, -1), which becomes "the square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one equals square root of forty-six." When substituting, I’ll express exponents properly and use function notation as needed, avoiding direct variable mentions for clarity.**Crafting TTS content and JSON format**

I need to create a clear TTS expression for my integral computation. For example, I’ll phrase it as "six to the power of three times t to the power of three times quantity four minus t times square root of forty-six d t." I'll use "d t" to avoid confusion with symbols. The output should include a well-structured problem statement with proper TTS formatting, step-by-step reasoning, and an explanation of each part. I'll ensure everything is textually represented without any math symbols, accurately following the guidelines for JSON format.
