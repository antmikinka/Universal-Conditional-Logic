=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I need to parameterize the curve C. 

Since it's a line segment, I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for a line segment from point A to point B is r(t) = A + t(B - A). Let me write that out.

Point A is (0,6,4) and point B is (6,3,3). So the vector from A to B is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Therefore, the parametric equations should be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds, which is the differential arc length. For a parameterized curve, ds = ||r'(t)|| dt. So first compute the derivative of r(t):

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

Then the magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x(t) and z(t) into the integrand. The integrand is x³ z, so:

x³ z = (6t)³ (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216*(4t³ - t⁴)

So the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [216*(4t³ - t⁴)] * sqrt(46) dt.

Let me factor out the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * integral from 0 to1 of (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Compute the integral of 4t³ - t⁴ dt. The antiderivative is 4*(t⁴/4) - (t⁵/5) = t⁴ - (t⁵)/5.

Evaluate from 0 to1: [1 - 1/5] - [0 -0] = 4/5.

So the integral is 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (216*4/5) * sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check that again. 216 times 4 is 864, over 5. So yes, 864/5 sqrt(46).

Let me verify each step. Parameterization: correct. Derivative: yes, 6, -3, -1. Magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), correct. Then x³ z: (6t)^3 is 216 t³, times (4 - t), correct. Then integral becomes 216*sqrt(46) times integral of (4t³ - t^4) dt from 0 to1. Integral of 4t³ is t^4, integral of t^4 is t^5/5. Evaluated at 1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. So yes, 216*4/5*sqrt(46) = 864/5 sqrt(46).

So the final answer should be 864/5 times sqrt(46). Let me check if that's simplified. 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, but as a fraction, 864/5 is fine. So the line integral evaluates to (864√46)/5.
