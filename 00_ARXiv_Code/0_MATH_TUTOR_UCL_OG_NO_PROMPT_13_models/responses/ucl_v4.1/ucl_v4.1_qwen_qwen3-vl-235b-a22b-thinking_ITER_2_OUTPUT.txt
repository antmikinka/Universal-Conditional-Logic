=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to evaluate the line integral of x³z ds over the curve C, which is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I need to recall how to compute a line integral. The formula for a line integral of a scalar function f(x,y,z) over a curve C is ∫_C f(x,y,z) ds, where ds is the differential arc length. To compute this, I usually parameterize the curve C, find ds in terms of the parameter, and then integrate over the parameter.

The curve C is a line segment from point A (0,6,4) to point B (6,3,3). So, I need to find a parametric equation for this line segment. A standard parameterization for a line segment between two points is r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t goes from 0 to 1.

Let me compute the direction vector first. The vector from A to B is B - A = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization would be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

for t in [0,1].

Next, I need to find ds. The differential arc length ds is given by ||r'(t)|| dt. Let's compute r'(t):

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integrand is x³z. Let's express x and z in terms of t:

x(t) = 6t, so x³ = (6t)³ = 216t³

z(t) = 4 - t

So the integrand becomes 216t³*(4 - t) = 216t³*4 - 216t⁴ = 864t³ - 216t⁴.

The line integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt.

Factor out sqrt(46):

sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt

Compute the integral term:

∫ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = 864*(t⁴/4) - 216*(t⁵/5) + C = 216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵

Evaluate from 0 to 1:

216*(1)⁴ - (216/5)*(1)⁵ - [0 - 0] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5

Multiply by sqrt(46):

(864/5) * sqrt(46)

So the final answer is (864√46)/5.

Now, I need to convert this into TTS-compatible format. Let's see:

The problem statement should be in natural language. The original problem says "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

Transforming the integral into TTS: "the line integral of x cubed z d s where C is the line segment from 0 comma 6 comma 4 to 6 comma 3 comma 3."

The answer is (864√46)/5. Let's convert each part:

- 864/5 is 172.8, but we should keep it as a fraction for accuracy. So "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six".

Wait, but in TTS, fractions are "numerator over denominator", so 864 over 5. So the answer would be "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six".

But let me check the rules. The transformation for fractions is "numerator over denominator", so 864/5 is "eight hundred sixty-four over five". The square root is "square root of forty-six".

So the main answer should be "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

Wait, but the exact form is (864√46)/5, which is the same as (864/5)√46. So yes, "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

In the scratchwork, I need to outline the steps in TTS format. Let's list the steps:

1. Parameterize the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) as x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, for t from zero to one.
2. Compute the derivative of the parameterization: the derivative of x with respect to t is six, derivative of y is negative three, derivative of z is negative one.
3. Find the magnitude of the derivative vector: square root of (six squared plus negative three squared plus negative one squared) equals square root of forty-six.
4. Express the integrand x cubed z in terms of t: (six t) cubed times (four minus t) equals two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t), which simplifies to eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth.
5. Multiply by the magnitude of the derivative to get the integrand in terms of t: (eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth) times square root of forty-six.
6. Integrate from t equals zero to t equals one: square root of forty-six times [two hundred sixteen t to the fourth minus (two hundred sixteen over five) t to the fifth] evaluated from zero to one.
7. Substitute the limits: square root of forty-six times (two hundred sixteen minus two hundred sixteen over five) equals square root of forty-six times (eight hundred sixty-four over five).
8. The final result is eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six.

Now, check the JSON structure. The problem number isn't given, so maybe it's null or empty. The question type is "fill_in_blanks" but here it's a calculation, so maybe "calculation". Wait, the problem says "Evaluate the line integral", so it's a calculation type.

Wait, the system rules say for fill-in-blanks with multiple blanks, but this seems like a single answer. So question_type might be "computation".

The math_content_check should be "yes" since it's a math problem.

Problem statement transformed into TTS: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed z d s where C is the line segment from 0 comma 6 comma 4 to 6 comma 3 comma 3."

Main answer values: ["eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"]

Scratchwork steps as a list of TTS steps.

Let me make sure all the transformations are correct. Coordinates use "comma" explicitly. The integral is transformed correctly. The answer is in the right format.

I think that's all. Now structure the JSON.
