=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

First, I need to parameterize the line segment C. The line segment goes from point A(0,6,4) to point B(6,3,3).

The parameterization of a line segment from point A to point B can be written as:
r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t ∈ [0,1]

So:
r(t) = (0,6,4) + t(6-0, 3-6, 3-4)
r(t) = (0,6,4) + t(6,-3,-1)
r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)

Now I need to find the derivative of r(t):
r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude of r'(t) is:
|r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

Now I need to express x³z in terms of t:
x = 6t
z = 4-t
So x³z = (6t)³(4-t) = 216t³(4-t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴

The line integral becomes:
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) |r'(t)| dt
= ∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) √46 dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt

Now I integrate:
∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = [216t⁴ - 43.2t⁵]_0^1
= (216(1)⁴ - 43.2(1)⁵) - (216(0)⁴ - 43.2(0)⁵)
= 216 - 43.2
= 172.8

So the line integral is:
√46 × 172.8

Let me calculate this:
√46 ≈ 6.7823
6.7823 × 172.8 ≈ 1171.5

Let me be more precise with the calculation:
√46 × 172.8 = 172.8√46

I should keep it in exact form rather than approximating:
172.8√46 = (864/5)√46

Actually, let me double-check my integration:
∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = [216t⁴ - 43.2t⁵]_0^1
= 216 - 43.2 = 172.8

This is correct.

So the final answer is 172.8√46.

Let me verify this calculation once more:
∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = 864∫_0^1 t³ dt - 216∫_0^1 t⁴ dt
= 864[t⁴/4]_0^1 - 216[t⁵/5]_0^1
= 864(1/4) - 216(1/5)
= 216 - 43.2
= 172.8

Yes, this is correct.

So the line integral is 172.8√46.
