=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, I need to parameterize the line segment C.
2. Then I need to compute ds in terms of the parameter.
3. Substitute everything into the integral and evaluate.

Step 1: Parameterize the line segment
The line segment goes from point A = (0,6,4) to point B = (6,3,3).

A parameterization can be:
r(t) = A + t(B - A) = (0,6,4) + t(6, -3, -1) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So:
x = 6t
y = 6-3t  
z = 4-t

Step 2: Compute ds
ds = |r'(t)| dt

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
|r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

So ds = √46 dt

Step 3: Set up and evaluate the integral
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4-t) √46 dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 216t³(4-t) dt
= 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt
= 216√46 [4(t⁴/4) - t⁵/5]_0^1
= 216√46 [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1
= 216√46 [1 - 1/5]
= 216√46 [4/5]
= (864/5)√46

Let me double-check this calculation:
216 × 4/5 = 864/5 ✓

So the final answer is (864/5)√46.

Now I need to format this according to the requirements. The problem is asking me to evaluate a line integral, so this is a calculation problem. I need to provide the answer in TTS-compatible format.
