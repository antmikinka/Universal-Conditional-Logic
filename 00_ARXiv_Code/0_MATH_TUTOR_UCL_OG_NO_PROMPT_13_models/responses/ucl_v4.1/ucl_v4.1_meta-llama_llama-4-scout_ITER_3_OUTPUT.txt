            "values": ["To evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to the arc length s along the line segment C from the point 0 comma 6 comma 4 to the point 6 comma 3 comma 3 we first parameterize the line segment C. The parametric equations of the line passing through the points 0 comma 6 comma 4 and 6 comma 3 comma 3 are given by x = 6t y = 6 - 3t z = 4 - t where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Then we compute ds as follows: ds = square root of ((dx/dt) squared + (dy/dt) squared + (dz/dt) squared) dt = square root of (6 squared + (-3) squared + (-1) squared) dt = square root of (36 + 9 + 1) dt = square root of 46 dt. Now we substitute x = 6t y = 6 - 3t z = 4 - t and ds = square root of 46 dt into the integral. The integral becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of (6t) cubed times (4 - t) times square root of 46 dt. Evaluating this integral gives us the final answer."],
