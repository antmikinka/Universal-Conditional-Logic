        "First, parameterize the line segment C as r of t equals open bracket 0 comma 6 comma 4 close bracket plus t times open bracket 6 minus 0 comma 3 minus 6 comma 3 minus 4 close bracket, which simplifies to open bracket 6t comma 6 minus 3t comma 4 plus t close bracket, where t ranges from 0 to 1.",
        "Next, compute the derivative of r with respect to t, which is r prime of t equals open bracket 6 comma negative 3 comma 1 close bracket.",
        "Then, compute the magnitude of r prime of t, which is the square root of 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus 1 squared, which equals the square root of 36 plus 9 plus 1, which equals the square root of 46.",
        "Now, substitute x equals 6t and z equals 4 plus t into the integrand x cubed z, which gives us open bracket 6t close bracket cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket, which simplifies to 216 t cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket, which equals 864 t cubed plus 216 t to the power of 4.",
        "Then, compute the line integral by integrating 864 t cubed plus 216 t to the power of 4 with respect to t from 0 to 1, multiplied by the magnitude of r prime of t, which is the square root of 46.",

        "Evaluating the integral from 0 to 1 gives us 216 times 1 to the power of 4 minus 216 times 0 to the power of 4 plus 216 times 1 to the power of 5 divided by 5 minus 216 times 0 to the power of 5 divided by 5, which simplifies to 216 plus 216 divided by 5, which equals 216 plus 43.2, which equals 259.2.",
        "Finally, multiply 259.2 by the square root of 46 to get the final result, which is approximately 259.2 times 6.782, which equals 1759.05. However, there was an error in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate.",
        "The correct integral is the integral from 0 to 1 of open bracket 6t close bracket cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket times the square root of 46 dt, which equals the square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of 216 t cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket dt.",
        "This simplifies to the square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of 864 t cubed plus 216 t to the power of 4 dt.",

        "The line integral is the integral of x cubed z ds. x equals 6t, z equals 4 plus t, and ds equals the square root of 46 dt. So the integral is the integral from 0 to 1 of open bracket 6t close bracket cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket times the square root of 46 dt.",
        "This simplifies to the square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of 216 t cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket dt.",
