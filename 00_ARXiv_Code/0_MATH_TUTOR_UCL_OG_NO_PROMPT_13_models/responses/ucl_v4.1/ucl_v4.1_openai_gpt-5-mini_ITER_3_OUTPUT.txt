**Calculating integrals**

Okay, I'm computing some integrals: for the first, from 0 to 1 for t cubed, I get one-fourth, and for t to the power of four, it's one-fifth. After some calculations, I find that 1 minus one-fifth gives me four-fifths. Multiplying that by 216 leads to a fraction of 864 over 5. I consider keeping it as a fraction and using natural language for the output without symbols, ensuring everything adheres to TTS transforms. I'll focus on creating a JSON template as well.**Writing the integral evaluation**

I need to write a statement for evaluating a line integral of x cubed times z over a specific line segment. I want to ensure I use transforms for exponentiation, like saying "x to the power of three," and explicitly mention vectors using "open bracket" and "close bracket." Importantly, I’ll avoid any mathematical symbols. 

For categorization, I will label it as a "line integral," confirm its math content, and provide a final answer in a TTS-friendly format—turning it into comprehensible phrases, preserving clarity and correctness.**Clarifying number representations**

It seems like I need to decide how to express numbers in a user-friendly way. While the transformation allows for numerals, the guidelines emphasize using natural spoken language without any mathematical symbols. So, I should spell out numbers, like "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six." This feels natural and avoids confusion, even if earlier rules allowed for some digits. My scratch work answer will include TTS-ready calculations, covering steps like parameterization and integration, ensuring everything is clear and consistent.**Applying transformation rules**

I need to follow the transformation rules carefully here, particularly around vector formatting, like using "open bracket" for components and ensuring to emphasize commas in coordinates. I should also set the answer format to "TTS ready," so everything's clear. 

For my JSON output, I am thinking of using `"problem_number": ""` since the problem image isn’t numbered. I’ll then craft the problem statement to evaluate the line integral of x to the power of 3 times z over a specific curve C, all while avoiding symbols and keeping the question type consistent as "line integral."**Building the JSON object**

I need to finalize the main answer values, including "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six." I might also consider including an alternative with digits, but since the values array allows for multiple entries, I’ll stick with one. 

For the scratch work, I'll lay out the steps in a TTS-ready format. When detailing the parameterization, I’ll use the form "r of t equals open bracket..." and ensure I’m clear about terms like the derivative and the norm, constantly emphasizing "comma" in my vector descriptions. 

Finally, I’ll ensure I convert fractions to words and prepare a JSON object that includes all these elements carefully formatted together.
