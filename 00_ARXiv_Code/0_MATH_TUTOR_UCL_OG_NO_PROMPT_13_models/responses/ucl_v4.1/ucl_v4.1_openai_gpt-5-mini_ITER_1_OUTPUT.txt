**Evaluating integral expression**

I’m working on the integral from 0 to 1 with the expression involving x, z, and sqrt46. It simplifies to a multiplication of fractions. I need to ensure I express this in a way that matches spoken language rules, converting math symbols into words properly. The final result should read as “eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six.” It’s crucial to follow the transformation specifications to avoid confusion.**Preparing TTS for final answers**

I need to ensure that the final answers and scratchwork are ready for text-to-speech. The problem number may be empty since there's no identifier present. It seems I should classify the question type as "line_integral." 

For the main answer, I can label it as "exact_value," containing a single TTS string for the final answer. The scratchwork steps should also be in TTS natural language. I’ll remember to transform the problem into words correctly, emphasizing phrases like "open bracket" and "close bracket" for coordinates, avoiding parentheses while vocalizing commas clearly.**Structuring TTS output steps**

I need to make sure the scratchwork steps follow the specified transformations, including referring to the norm as "square root of forty-six." I think I should use words for numbers for clarity, like "zero," "six," "four," and so on, since the problem statement needs to contain only natural spoken language without any mathematical symbols. 

For the square root, I’ll keep it as "square root of forty-six," and for exponents, saying "six to the power of three" works. I’ll ensure everything is structured correctly in JSON format as required, starting with the right fields like problem_number, problem_statement, and so on.**Crafting the problem details**

I'm getting ready to structure my output. The problem number will be empty since there's none to reference. The problem statement needs to articulate the integral clearly, saying: "Evaluate the line integral of x to the power of three times z with respect to arc length over curve C, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero, six, four close bracket to open bracket six, three, three close bracket." 

The question type is definitely "line_integral." I’ve confirmed there’s math content, so I’ll note that as "yes." The main answer type will be "exact_value," and the value is "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six." The scratchwork will consist of multiple steps, presented simply as an array of strings in natural language.**Assembling the problem parameters**

I’m starting with the parameterization of r of t as "open bracket six t, six minus three t, four minus t close bracket" for t ranging from zero to one. I can spell out "equals" for clarity. Next, I'll compute the derivative, which is "open bracket six, negative three, negative one close bracket." The norm of this is the "square root of forty-six," making sure I refer to the negative numbers correctly as "negative three."

Then, I’ll express ds in terms of dt as "square root of forty-six dt." After that, by substituting x and z into the integrand, it results in "216 t to the power of three times the quantity four minus t end quantity." I’ll note the integral also simplifies to "square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one." 

When evaluating the integral, I’ll ensure I express the numbers in words, like "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six." Finally, I’ll prepare the JSON with proper escaping of quotes and format.
