=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to evaluate the line integral of x cubed z ds over the curve C, which is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I need to recall how to compute a line integral with respect to arc length.

The line integral ∫_C x³ z ds. For a line integral, I need to parameterize the curve C. Since it's a straight line segment, I can use a parameter t from 0 to 1. The parametric equations for the line from point A (0,6,4) to point B (6,3,3) can be written as:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t (since 6 to 3 is a decrease of 3 over t from 0 to1)

z(t) = 4 - t (from 4 to 3, decrease of 1)

Wait, let me check the direction. The change in x is 6-0=6, so x(t) = 0 + 6t. For y, it's 3-6=-3, so y(t)=6 -3t. For z, 3-4=-1, so z(t)=4 - t. Yes, that's correct.

Next, I need to find ds, which is the magnitude of the derivative of the position vector with respect to t, times dt. The position vector r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t). Then r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 +9 +1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x(t), z(t), and ds into the integral. The integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of [ (6t)^3 * (4 - t) ] * sqrt(46) dt.

Let's compute that step by step. First, (6t)^3 is 216 t³. Multiply by (4 - t): 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216*(4t³ - t^4). Then multiply by sqrt(46), so the integral is sqrt(46) * 216 ∫ (4t³ - t^4) dt from 0 to1.

Compute the integral: ∫4t³ dt is 4*(t^4/4) = t^4, and ∫t^4 dt is t^5/5. So evaluated from 0 to1, it's [1^4 - (1^5)/5] - [0] = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

Wait, wait. Wait, the integral of 4t³ - t^4 is [4*(t^4/4) - t^5/5] from 0 to1 = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to1 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5.

So the integral becomes sqrt(46)*216*(4/5) = (216*4/5)*sqrt(46) = (864/5)*sqrt(46).

Wait, but 216*4 is 864, yes. So 864/5 is 172.8. But the answer should be in exact form. So 864 sqrt(46)/5.

Let me verify the calculation again. The integral of (4t³ - t^4) from 0 to1:

Integral of 4t³ is 4*(t^4/4) = t^4.

Integral of t^4 is t^5/5.

So the integral is t^4 - (t^5)/5 evaluated from 0 to1, which is (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5. Correct.

Multiply by 216 and sqrt(46): 216*(4/5) = 864/5. So the final answer is (864/5) sqrt(46).

Now, convert this to TTS format. The problem is a line integral, so the question type is "line_integral_calculation". The math_content_check is "yes" since it's a math problem.

For the problem statement in TTS: "Evaluate the line integral: the integral over C of x cubed z d s where C is the line segment from (0 comma 6 comma 4) to (6 comma 3 comma 3)."

The main answer is 864 divided by 5 times the square root of 46. In TTS: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths square root of forty-six" or more precisely, "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

Wait, according to the transformation rules, fractions should be "numerator over denominator". So 864/5 is "eight hundred sixty-four over five". Then multiplied by sqrt(46), which is "square root of forty-six".

So the main answer values should be ["eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"].

Scratchwork steps: need to list the calculation steps in TTS. Let's outline them:

1. Parameterize the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3) using t from 0 to 1: x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t.

2. Compute the derivative of the position vector: the components are six comma negative three comma negative one.

3. Find the magnitude of the derivative: square root of (six squared plus negative three squared plus negative one squared) equals square root of (thirty-six plus nine plus one) equals square root of forty-six.

4. Express ds as square root of forty-six d t.

5. Substitute x cubed z into the integral: (six t) cubed times (four minus t) equals two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t).

6. Expand the integrand: two hundred sixteen times (four t cubed minus t to the fourth).

7. Integrate from t equals zero to one: two hundred sixteen times the integral of (four t cubed minus t to the fourth) d t equals two hundred sixteen times [t to the fourth minus (t to the fifth over five)] evaluated from zero to one.

8. Evaluate the definite integral: two hundred sixteen times (one minus one fifth) equals two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths.

9. Multiply by square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six.

So the scratchwork values would be these steps in TTS format.

Now, structure the JSON. Problem number is not given, so maybe leave as empty or "1"? The problem statement in TTS as per the rules.

Wait, the problem statement in the output must be only natural spoken language with zero mathematical symbols. So convert the original problem into that.

Original problem: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds Where: C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)."

Converted to TTS:

"evaluate the line integral: the integral over C of x cubed z d s where C is the line segment from (0 comma 6 comma 4) to (6 comma 3 comma 3)."

Check the rules: coordinates have "comma" explicitly. So (0 comma 6 comma 4) etc.

Question type: line_integral_calculation.

Math_content_check: yes.

Main answer: ["eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"]

Scratchwork steps as listed above, each step in TTS.

Now, ensure the JSON is correctly formatted. The problem_number might need to be set. Since the user didn't specify, maybe set to "1" or leave as empty. The problem statement should be the converted TTS version.

Let me check the JSON template. The problem_number is extracted identifier; since it's not given, perhaps set to "1" as a default.

Putting it all together.
