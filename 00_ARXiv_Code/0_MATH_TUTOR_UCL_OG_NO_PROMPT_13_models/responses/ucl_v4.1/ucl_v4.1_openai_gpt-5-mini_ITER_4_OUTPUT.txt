**Calculating integral value**

I'm computing ds, which involves taking the norm of r'(t) = (6, -3, -1) to find its length, resulting in sqrt(46). Then, I'm working through the integral from 0 to 1 for the expression involving (x^3 z) and that norm. Ultimately, I simplify it to (864/5) times sqrt(46). I plan to express this in natural spoken language, saying "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six" for clarity.**Transforming integral expression**

I'm interpreting the phrase about evaluating the line integral of x cubed times z concerning arc length over curve C, which spans from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). I need to avoid symbols like ^ and instead, use natural spoken language. So, I'll say "x to the power of three times z" for the function and "with respect to arc length" for ds. I'll also ensure that I emphasize "comma" while stating the coordinates. It feels like I'm covering all the bases here!**Evaluating the line integral**

I’m addressing the problem statement, which involves evaluating the line integral of x to the power of three times z, with respect to arc length over curve C. This curve stretches from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3), and I need to avoid mathematical symbols. I’ll transform everything into TTS-ready words, like using “parameterization r of t” for the vector components. I’ll express fractions as "numerator over denominator" and state the bounds clearly as "from zero to one," ensuring all operations are pronounced clearly.**Formatting the final answer**

For the main answer, I’ll say "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six," which is the clear and precise way to express it. I can also include a decimal approximation, but the exact form is preferable. I need to create JSON fields following the template, ensuring that the scratchwork steps are presented as an array with each step as a separate string for clarity. I'll start with the parameterization of C as “r of t equals open bracket six t, six minus three t, four minus t close bracket for t from zero to one.”**Crafting the JSON output**

I'm outlining the steps for computing the line integral. First, I compute the derivative, resulting in r prime of t as (6, -3, -1). Then, I find the norm as square root of forty-six. For the integrand, I substitute x and z values, transforming t^3 into "t to the power of three." The line integral then reads as an integral from zero to one of the expression, factoring out constants. After evaluating the integral, I arrive at eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six. Now I need to format this in the JSON structure appropriately.
