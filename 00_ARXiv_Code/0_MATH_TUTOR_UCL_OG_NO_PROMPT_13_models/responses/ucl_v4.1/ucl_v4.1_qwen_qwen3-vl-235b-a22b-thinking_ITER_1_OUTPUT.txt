=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). 

First, I need to parametrize the curve C. A line segment between two points can be parametrized using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for a line segment from point A to point B is r(t) = A + t(B - A).

So, the starting point A is (0, 6, 4) and the ending point B is (6, 3, 3). Let's compute B - A: (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Therefore, the parametrization is r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) where t ∈ [0, 1].

Next, I need to find ds. For a parametrized curve r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), ds is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, multiplied by dt. So, first find r'(t):

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, express x³ z in terms of t. From the parametrization, x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t. Therefore, x³ z = (6t)³ (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216*(4t³ - t⁴).

The integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of [216*(4t³ - t⁴)] * sqrt(46) dt. Factor out the constants: 216*sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Compute the integral: ∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - (t⁵)/5] from 0 to 1. Plugging in the limits: (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5.

Multiply by the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46). Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 216 * 4 = 864, and 864/5 is 172.8. So the final answer is (864 sqrt(46))/5.

Let me verify each step. The parametrization seems correct. The derivative is correct, magnitude sqrt(46). The substitution of x and z into the integrand is right. The integral of 4t³ is t^4, integral of t^4 is t^5/5. Evaluated from 0 to 1 gives 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Multiply by 216*sqrt(46), so yes, 216*(4/5) is 864/5. So the answer is (864/5) times sqrt(46).
