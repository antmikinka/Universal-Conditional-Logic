I need to evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\), where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\). First, I recall that for a line integral with respect to arc length, \(ds\), I need to parameterize the curve and then express everything in terms of a single parameter.

So, let's parameterize the line segment. Points are \((0,6,4)\) and \((6,3,3)\). The direction vector is \((6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1)\). So, I can write the parametric equations as:

\[x = 0 + 6t\]

\[y = 6 - 3t\]

\[z = 4 - t\]

When \(t = 0\), \(x=0\), \(y=6\), \(z=4\), good. When \(t=1\), \(x=6\), \(y=3\), \(z=3\), perfect. So, \(t\) from 0 to 1.

Now, for a line integral \(\int_C f(x,y,z)  ds\), I need to compute \(\int_a^b f(\mathbf{r}(t)) \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|  dt\), where \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))\).

So, first, find \(\mathbf{r}'(t)\). From above, \(\mathbf{r}(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t)\). So,

\[\mathbf{r}'(t) = (6, -3, -1)\]

Now, the magnitude \(\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|\) is \(\sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}\).

It's constant since it's a straight line. Good.

Now, the function is \(f(x,y,z) = x^3 z\). So, plugging in the parameterization:

\[x = 6t\]

\[z = 4 - t\]

So, \(x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216 (4t^3 - t^4) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4\).

I'll keep it as \(216 t^3 (4 - t)\) for now, but maybe expand for integration.

So, the integral is:

\[\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_0^1 f(\mathbf{r}(t)) \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|  dt = \int_0^1 (x^3 z) \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 t^3 (4 - t)  dt\]

Since \(\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|\) is constant.

So, let's compute that. First, \(216 \times \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 t^3 (4 - t)  dt\).

Now, \(\int_0^1 t^3 (4 - t)  dt = \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt\)

Integrate term by term.

Antiderivative of \(4t^3\) is \(4 \times \frac{t^4}{4} = t^4\)

Antiderivative of \(-t^4\) is \(-\frac{t^5}{5}\)

So, \(\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1\)

At t=1: \(1^4 - \frac{1^5}{5} = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\)

At t=0: 0

So, 0.8, or fraction: \(1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}\)

So, \(\int = \frac{4}{5}\)

But I have 216 and \(\sqrt{46}\), so total integral is \(\sqrt{46} \times 216 \times \frac{4}{5}\)

From above: \(\sqrt{46} \times \int (x^3 z) dt\) but \(x^3 z\) is 216 t^3 (4-t), and I integrated that part to 4/5, so yes.

So, \(\sqrt{46} \times 216 \times \frac{4}{5}\)

Now, let me compute that.

First, \(216 \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{216 \times 4}{5} = \frac{864}{5} = 172.8\)

But better to keep fractions.

216/5 * 4 = 864 / 5? No.

216 × 4 / 5 = 864 / 5

Yes.

Now, multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\), so \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\)

I can simplify this.

Notice that 864 and 5 have no common factors, but I can write it as \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

But maybe I should check if I can reduce.

Another way: \(\sqrt{46} \times 216 \times \frac{4}{5} = \sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5}\)

Now, 864 and 5 are coprime, but 864 can be simplified? No, but I can write it as \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\)

But perhaps I can factor out numbers.

Recall that \(\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36+9+1} = \sqrt{46}\), yes.

And \(x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t)\)

Integral of 216 t^3 (4-t) dt from 0 to 1 is 216 * 4/5? No.

\(\int_0^1 t^3 (4-t) dt = \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}]_0^1 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 = 4/5\), yes.

So integral of the function times dt is \(\frac{4}{5}\), but that's without the speed part.

The integral is \(\sqrt{46} \times \int f dt\), and \(\int f dt = \int 216 t^3 (4-t) dt = 216 \times \frac{4}{5} ? No.

216 times the integral of (4t^3 - t^4) dt, which is 216 * (4/5) ? No.

The integral is \(\int 216 t^3 (4-t) dt\), and I have \(\int (4t^3 - t^4) dt\) is 4/5, but 216 is constant, so it's 216 times that integral.

Set g(t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t)

Then \(\int_0^1 g(t) dt = 216 \int_0^1 t^3 (4-t) dt = 216 \times \frac{4}{5} ? No.

\(\int_0^1 t^3 (4-t) dt = \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}\)

So \(\int g(t) dt = 216 \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864}{5}\)

Then multiplied by \(\|\mathbf{r}'\| = \sqrt{46}\), so total integral is \(\sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

Now, I can simplify this fraction. First, 864 and 5, 5 is prime, 864 ÷ 2? 864 is not divisible by 5? 864 ends with 4, so no, coprime. But I can write it as \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\), but maybe reduce 864.

864 divided by 2 is 432, again 216, 108, 54, 27, so 864 = 2^5 * 3^3, but since denominator is 5, no simplification. But I notice that in the magnitude, I have \(\sqrt{46}\), and 46=2*23, so no squares, so it's fine.

But perhaps I made a mistake because the answer might simplify.

Another way: I can compute the integral as \(\int_0^1 216 t^3 (4-t) \sqrt{46}  dt\), but since sqrt(46) is constant, same as before.

So, \(\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = \sqrt{46} \times 216 \times \frac{4}{5} \times ? No, same thing.

\(\int (4t^3 - t^4) dt\) from 0 to 1 is 4/5, times 216 is 864/5, times sqrt(46).

But let me calculate numerically to check.

First, sqrt(46) ≈ sqrt(49)=7, sqrt(36)=6, so about 6.782

864/5 = 172.8

172.8 * 6.782 ≈ let's see, 170*6.8=1156, 2.8*6.8≈19.04, total 1175.04, but better: 172.8 * 6.782

First, 172.8 * 6 = 1036.8

172.8 * 0.7 = 120.96

172.8 * 0.082 = 172.8 * 0.08 = 13.824, 172.8 * 0.002 = 0.3456, so 14.1696

Total: 1036.8 + 120.96 = 1157.76 + 14.1696 ≈ 1171.9296

But this is approximate, and I need exact value.

I think I forgot the sqrt(46) is part of it, but in the expression it's multiplied, but perhaps I can write it as fraction.

Another thought: the magnitude is sqrt(46), but let me confirm the direction vector.

From (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), difference (6,-3,-1), magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), yes.

Now, f = x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t), yes.

Integral from 0 to 1 of that times ds/dt dt, but ds/dt = ||dr/dt|| = sqrt(46), and dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1, yes.

The integral is ∫ f ds = ∫ f(t) ||r'(t)|| dt from 0 to 1.

Yes.

Now, so mathematically, it's \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But 864/5 is 172.8, but perhaps I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

Notice that 864 and 5 have no common factors, but 864 can be divided by 2, but denominator is 5, so it's fine. Perhaps simplify by factoring.

Another way: \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

216/5 is 43.2, but same.

Perhaps I can write it as 172.8 \sqrt{46}, but better to keep fractional.

But let me see if I made a mistake in the function.

x^3 z, x=6t, z=4-t, so x^3 = (6t)^3 = 216 t^3, z=4-t, so product 216 t^3 (4-t), yes.

Integral of t^3 (4-t) dt from 0 to 1.

Let me compute the integral without the constant.

∫_0^1 4t^3 - t^4 dt = 4*(1/4) - 1/5 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, yes.

4* (t^4/4) from 0 to 1 is 1, minus (t^5/5) from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5, yes.

So 216 * 4/5 = 216*0.8 = 172.8, but 216*4 = 864, divided by 5, yes.

Now times sqrt(46).

So \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, or simplify by dividing numerator and denominator, but 864 and 5 coprime, so it's fine.

Notice that 864 and 5 have no common factors, and 46 has no square factors, so it's simplified.

But in the expression, I have it as the final answer, but let me check if I need to rationalize or something, but for line integrals, it's common to leave like that.

Perhaps I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}, but let me see if I can reduce 864/5, but it's already a fraction.

Another thought: when I parameterized, I used t from 0 to 1, but sometimes people use other parameters, but it should be fine.

I could parameterize by arc length, but that would be more work.

The total length of the line segment. Direction vector magnitude sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), as we have.

The parameter t from 0 to 1 corresponds to arc length s = t * ||v|| = t * sqrt(46), since v is constant speed.

But in the integral, it's already handled.

Another way to think: the integral is ∫ x^3 z ds.

I can express in terms of x or z.

But since it's a straight line, and I have the parameterization, it should be fine.

Let me compute numerically to verify.

Take t from 0 to 1, with small steps.

Say, t=0, x=0, z=4, f=0^3*4=0

t=0.5, x=6*0.5=3, z=4-0.5=3.5, f=3^3 * 3.5 = 27*3.5=94.5

||r'||=sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46)≈6.782

ds ≈ ||dr||, but for integration, better to use the integral we have.

At t=0.5, f ds/dt = f * ||r'|| ≈ 94.5 * 6.782 ≈ let's see, 100*6.782=678.2, but 94.5 is less, 95*6.782≈644.29, minus 0.5*6.782≈3.391, so ≈640.9, but this is per unit dt, but we need to integrate.

The expression for f at t=0.5 is 216*(0.5)^3*(4-0.5)=216*0.125*3.5

216*0.125=27, 27*3.5=94.5, yes.

Then f * ||r'|| ≈94.5 * 6.782 ≈ as above ≈640.9, but this is the instantaneous rate, to integrate from 0 to 1, we have the whole integral as about 1172 as I calculated earlier, but at midpoint it's 640, and since it's increasing then decreasing, but anyway.

Our analytical solution is about 1172, but earlier I had 1171.9296, but that was for the integral value, but in our case, the integral of f ds is that number, but in my numerical, at t=0.5, the contribution is f||r'|| dt, but dt is not ds, ds = ||r'|| dt, so when I multiply f ds/dt dt? I'm confusing.

In the integral ∫ f ds, in terms of t, it's ∫ f(t) ||r'(t)|| dt.

At each point, the integrand is f(t) ||r'(t)||, which has units of (length^? well, f is x^3 z, x and z in length, so length^4? x^3 z is (length)^3 * (length) = length^4, ds is length, so integral length^5? Dimensional analysis, but anyway.

In my calculation, at t=0.5, the integrand value is f * ||r'|| ≈94.5 * 6.782 ≈ 640.9, but this is for dt, but since dt is differential, to compute the integral, I need to integrate this over t.

But analytically, we have ∫ g(t) dt with g(t) = f(t) ||r'(t)|| = 216 t^3 (4-t) * sqrt(46)

So g(t) = sqrt(46) * 216 (4t^3 - t^4)

At t=0.5, 4*(0.125) - (0.0625) = 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375? 4t^3 =4*0.125=0.5, t^4=0.0625, so 4t^3 - t^4=0.5 - 0.0625=0.4375

Then g(t)= sqrt(46) * 216 * 0.4375

First, 216 * 0.4375, 0.4375 is 7/16? 0.4375=7/16? 7/16=0.4375 yes.

216 * 7 / 16 = (216/16)*7 = 13.5 *7 = 94.5, same as before.

Then times sqrt(46)≈94.5*6.782≈640.9, as before.

Now, the integral from 0 to 1 of g(t) dt is what we computed as approximately 1172, and since g(t) max is at some point, but at t=0.5, it's 640.9, and lower at ends, average maybe around 500 or something, times 1, so 500, but 1172 is higher, but since at t=0 and t=1, g(0)=0, g(1)=216*1^3*(4-1)=216*1*3=648, times sqrt(46)≈648*6.782≈4396.336? No.

g(t) at t=1: f(t)=x^3 z=6^3 * (4-1)? t=1, x=6*1=6, z=4-1=3, so 6^3 *3=216*3=648

Then g(t)=f*||r'||=648 * sqrt(46)≈648*6.782≈4396.336? But this is a point, but the function is not constant.

At t=0, g=0, at t=1, g=648*6.782≈4396, at t=0.5≈640.9, so it's increasing, average maybe 2000 or so, times 1, so integral around 2000, but my earlier analytical gave 1172, which is less, so I must have miscalculated the average.

At t=0.5, I have 640.9, at t=1, 4396, so if linear or something, but it's not, since it's t^3 and t^4.

The integral we computed is exactly \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} ≈ 864/5 =172.8, 172.8*6.782≈ let's calculate: 170*6.782=1152.94, 2.8*6.782≈19, total 1171.94, as before.

But at t=0.5, it's 640.9, which is for the integrand, but since it's increasing, average value might be around (0 + 4396)/2 =2198 for rough average, but 2198*1=2198, but our integral is only 1172, which is less, so inconsistency.

g(t) at t=0.5 is f(t) * ||r'|| = 94.5 * sqrt(46) ≈94.5*6.782.

94.5 *6 = 567, 94.5*0.782.

94.5*0.7=66.15, 94.5*0.082=94.5*0.08=7.56, 94.5*0.002=0.189, total 7.56+0.189=7.749, so 66.15+7.749=73.899, so total g(t)=567+73.899=640.899, yes.

At t=1, f=6^3*3=216*3=648, g=648*sqrt(46)≈648*6.782.

648*6=3888, 648*0.782.

648*0.7=453.6, 648*0.082=648*0.08=51.84, 648*0.002=1.296, so 51.84+1.296=53.136, total 453.6+53.136=506.736, so g=3888+506.736=4394.736, say 4395.

At t=0, g=0.

So from 0 to 4395 at t=1. The function g(t) = 216 * sqrt(46) * (4t^3 - t^4)

Since sqrt(46) is constant, and 216 constant, so g(t) proportional to 4t^3 - t^4.

Let h(t) = 4t^3 - t^4, from 0 to 1, h(0)=0, h(0.5)=4*(0.125)-0.0625=0.5-0.0625=0.4375, h(1)=4-1=3.

h(t) is zero at 0, 0.4375 at 0.5, 3 at 1, so it's increasing.

Average of h(t) over [0,1] is ∫h(t)dt /1 = [t^4 - t^5/5]_0^1 =1 - 1/5 =0.8, as before.

So average h is 0.8, so average g is 216 * sqrt(46) * 0.8 = 172.8 * sqrt(46), as before.

In my earlier mistake, I said at t=1, g=648*sqrt(46)≈4395, but that's h(t)=3, since at t=1, h(1)=4*1^3 -1^4=4-1=3, and at t=0.5, h=0.4375, yes.

So average h is 0.8, so average g is 216 * sqrt(46) * average h, but average h is 0.8, and 216*0.8=172.8, times sqrt(46), yes, about 1172.

And at t=1, h=3, but that's the value, but average is 0.8, which is reasonable since it starts at 0 and ends at 3, but since it's cubic, it increases slowly at first, then faster, so average less than 1.5, 0.8 is fine.

So analytical is correct.

Now back to the answer.

So integral is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But perhaps simplify by factoring out common factors.

Notice that 864/5 is already simplified, but I can write the whole thing as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Since 864 and 5 have no common factors, and 46 has no squares, it's fine.

I could write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} = 172.8 \sqrt{46}, but better as fraction.

Another way: \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

216/1, etc.

Perhaps reduce by dividing numerator and denominator, but no.

I recall that in the magnitude, it's common, but here it's part of the answer.

Perhaps the problem expects the answer simplified.

Another thought: I can factor out constants.

Notice that in the parameterization, I used the vector (6,-3,-1), but sometimes people use a unit vector, but in this case, it's not necessary.

I could parameterize by the vector.

Set the parameter as the distance, but that might be messy.

Set s as arc length, from s=0 at start, s=||v|| = sqrt(46) at end, since t from 0 to 1, s = t * sqrt(46)

So s = k t, with k=sqrt(46)

Then t = s / sqrt(46)

Then x = 6 t = 6 s / sqrt(46)

Similarly, y = 6 - 3 s / sqrt(46)

z = 4 - s / sqrt(46)

Then f = x^3 z = [6 s / sqrt(46)]^3 * [4 - s / sqrt(46)]

= 216 s^3 / (46^{3/2}) * (4 - s / \sqrt{46})

46^{3/2} = (46 * sqrt(46)) = 46^{1.5}, but messy.

f = [216 s^3 / (46\sqrt{46}) ] * (4 - s / \sqrt{46}) since 46^{3/2} = 46 * 46^{1/2} = 46 \sqrt{46}

46^{3/2} = (46^1) * (46^{1/2}) = 46 \sqrt{46}

Yes.

Now, the integral is ∫_{s=0}^{s=\sqrt{46}} f ds = ∫_0^{\sqrt{46}} \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} \left(4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}}\right) ds

Simplify: \frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}} \int_0^{\sqrt{46}} s^3 \left(4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}}\right) ds

Now, 216 / 46? Simplify.

216 and 46, both divisible by 2.

216 ÷ 2 = 108

46 ÷ 2 = 23

So \frac{108 \sqrt{46}}{23 \sqrt{46}}? No.

From above: \frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}} = \frac{216}{46} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{46}} = \frac{108}{23} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{46}} = \frac{108}{23 \sqrt{46}}

Now, the integral is that times ∫ s^3 (4 - s / sqrt(46)) ds from 0 to sqrt(46)

Set u = s / sqrt(46), but since it's definite, might be messy.

Compute the integral.

Since I already have the answer, but to match, earlier we had constant times integral, but it will lead to same thing.

Note that in this expression, the constant is \frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}} = \frac{108}{23 \sqrt{46}}

But earlier we had \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}, let me see if same.

\frac{108}{23 \sqrt{46}} should be part, but then multiplied by the integral.

The integral is ∫_0^{\sqrt{46}} s^3 (4 - s / \sqrt{46}) ds

Set w = s / \sqrt{46}, then when s=0, w=0; s=\sqrt{46}, w=1.

ds = \sqrt{46} dw

Now, s = w \sqrt{46}

So s^3 = [w \sqrt{46}]^3 = w^3 * 46^{3/2} = w^3 * 46 \sqrt{46} ? 46^{1.5} = 46 * 46^{0.5} = 46 \sqrt{46}

Yes.

Then s / \sqrt{46} = w \sqrt{46} / \sqrt{46} = w

So 4 - s / \sqrt{46} = 4 - w

Now, integral becomes ∫_0^1 [w^3 * 46 \sqrt{46}] * [4 - w] * \sqrt{46} dw

Since ds = \sqrt{46} dw

So = ∫_0^1 w^3 * 46 \sqrt{46} * (4 - w) * \sqrt{46} dw

= ∫_0^1 w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * ( \sqrt{46} )^2 dw

(\sqrt{46})^2 = 46

So ∫_0^1 w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * 46 dw

46 * 46? No

In the expression: w^3 * 46 \sqrt{46} * (4 - w) * \sqrt{46} dw = w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * (\sqrt{46})^2 * dw = w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * 46 dw

46 * 46 = 2116? But earlier we had different.

(\sqrt{46})^2 = 46, and there is already a 46 from s^3, no.

From above: the terms are: w^3 from s^3, but s^3 contributed w^3 * 46 \sqrt{46}? Let's see:

s^3 = [w \sqrt{46}]^3 = w^3 * 46^{3/2} = w^3 * 46 \sqrt{46}  (since 46^{3/2} = 46^{1} * 46^{1/2} = 46 \sqrt{46})

Then multiplied by (4 - w)

Then by ds = \sqrt{46} dw

So total: w^3 * 46 \sqrt{46} * (4 - w) * \sqrt{46} dw

Now, \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46

So overall: w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * 46 dw

46 \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46 * 46? No:

w^3 * (46 \sqrt{46}) * (4 - w) * (\sqrt{46}) dw = w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * (\sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46}) dw = w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * 46 dw? \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = (\sqrt{46})^2 = 46

But 46 \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46 * 46? No:

46 \sqrt{46} is a factor, times another \sqrt{46}, so (46 \sqrt{46}) * \sqrt{46} = 46 * (\sqrt{46})^2 = 46 * 46 = 46^2? No.

46 \sqrt{46} is 46 times sqrt(46), times sqrt(46) is 46 times [sqrt(46)]^2 = 46 * 46 = 2116? But that's for the constant part.

The coefficient is w^3 (4 - w) times the numerical constant.

From above: the integrand before dw is w^3 * [46 \sqrt{46}] * [4 - w] * [\sqrt{46}] 

So = w^3 (4 - w) * 46 \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * 46 ? No:

46 \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46 * (\sqrt{46})^2 = 46 * 46 = 2116? But (\sqrt{46})^2 is 46, yes, but 46 * \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46 * 46 = 2116? Only if it's multiplied last, but:

Set c = 46 \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46 * (\sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46}) = 46 * 46 = 2116? But \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46, yes, and 46 * 46 = 2116, but 46 is coefficient, but in the expression it's 46 times \sqrt{46} times \sqrt{46}, which is 46 * 46 = 2116.

46 \sqrt{46} times \sqrt{46} = 46 * \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46 * 46 = 2116, yes.

But earlier I have w^3 and (4-w), so the integrand is 2116 * w^3 (4 - w) dw? But this is for the s part, but this is the entire expression for the integral part, but I forgot the constant factor from earlier.

Recall.

In this substitution, I have to multiply by the constant that was outside.

Earlier, the entire integral is:

\frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}} \times \int s^3 (4 - s/\sqrt{46}) ds

But after substitution, the integral is ∫_0^1 ... dw, which we found is ∫_0^1 w^3 (4 - w) * 46 * 46 ? From above, the integral expression is:

From above calculation: ∫ w^3 (4 - w) * (46 \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46}) dw = ∫ w^3 (4 - w) * (46 * 46) dw? 46 \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46 * 46 = 2116, as I said, but:

46 \sqrt{46} is a number, times \sqrt{46} is 46 * 46 = 2116, yes, since \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} = 46.

So yes, the integrand for w is 2116 w^3 (4 - w) dw

But 2116 w^3 (4 - w) is 2116 (4w^3 - w^4)

But this is for the inner integral, but I need to multiply by the constant in front.

The constant is \frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}}

So total integral is \frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}} \times 2116 \times \int_0^1 (4w^3 - w^4) dw

\int_0^1 (4w^3 - w^4) dw is same as before, [w^4 - w^5/5]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

Now, numerically: 2116 is large, but let's compute.

First, \frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}} times 2116

But 2116 / (46 \sqrt{46}) ? Let's see.

Note that 2116 = 46 * 46? 46*46=2116, yes.

46*46=2116, yes.

So \frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}} \times 2116 = \frac{216}{46 \sqrt{46}} \times 46 \times 46 = \frac{216 \times 46 \times 46}{46 \sqrt{46}} = \frac{216 \times 46}{\sqrt{46}}

Simplify: 216 * 46 / \sqrt{46}

Now, 46 / \sqrt{46} = \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} / \sqrt{46} = \sqrt{46}, no.

46 / \sqrt{46} = \sqrt{46} * \sqrt{46} / \sqrt{46} = \sqrt{46}, but wait.

a / \sqrt{a} = \sqrt{a}

Yes, since a / a^{1/2} = a^{1 - 1/2} = a^{1/2} = \sqrt{a}

So 46 / \sqrt{46} = \sqrt{46}

Thus, \frac{216 \times 46}{\sqrt{46}} = 216 \times \sqrt{46}

Then multiplied by the integral which is 4/5, so total integral is 216 * \sqrt{46} * \frac{4}{5} = \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Same as before! So it matches.

Therefore, the answer is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but in boxed answer, probably \dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, perhaps simplify by writing 864/5 as fraction, but it's already.

Note that 864 and 5 have no common factors, so it's fine.

I could write it as \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5} or reduce by dividing numerator and denominator, but can't.

Another way: \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{216}{5} \times 4 \sqrt{46}, but same.

I think it's acceptable.

So, the line integral evaluates to \dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me confirm the calculation once more.

x = 6t, z=4-t

x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t)

||dr/dt|| = \sqrt{(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36+9+1}=\sqrt{46}

Integral = \int_0^1 216 t^3 (4-t) \sqrt{46}  dt

Since \sqrt{46} constant, = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 (4t^3 - t^4) dt

\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}]_0^1 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 = \frac{4}{5}

So \sqrt{46} \times 216 \times \frac{4}{5} = \sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5}

Yes.

216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5, yes.

So final answer.

I think that's it.


==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\), where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), parameterize the curve. The direction vector is \((6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1)\). Thus, the parametric equations are:

\[
x = 6t, \quad y = 6 - 3t, \quad z = 4 - t, \quad \text{for} \quad t \in [0, 1].
\]

The derivative is \(\mathbf{r}'(t) = (6, -3, -1)\), and its magnitude is:

\[
\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}.
\]

The function is \(f(x, y, z) = x^3 z\). Substituting the parameterization:

\[
x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.
\]

The line integral is given by:

\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_0^1 f(\mathbf{r}(t)) \|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|  dt = \int_0^1 216 t^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46}  dt.
\]

Since \(\sqrt{46}\) is constant, factor it out:

\[
\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt.
\]

Evaluate the integral:

\[
\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left(1^4 - \frac{1^5}{5}\right) - (0) = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\int_0^1 216 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = 216 \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864}{5}.
\]

Multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\):

\[
\sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}.
\]

The fraction \(\frac{864}{5}\) is already simplified, as 864 and 5 are coprime, and \(\sqrt{46}\) has no perfect square factors other than 1. Therefore, the value of the line integral is \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\).

\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
