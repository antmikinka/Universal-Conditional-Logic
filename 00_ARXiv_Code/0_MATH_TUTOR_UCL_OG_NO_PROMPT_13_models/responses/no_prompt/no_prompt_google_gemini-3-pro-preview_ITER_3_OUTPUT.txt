**Analyzing the Problem**

I've started mapping out the given information. The problem is a scalar line integral. My main focus now is understanding how to parametrize the line segment $C$ between the specified points. Once I can do that, I'll be able to set up the integral and solve it.


**Developing the Parameterization**

I've successfully parameterized the line segment. The parametric equations are $x(t) = 6t$, $y(t) = 6-3t$, and $z(t) = 4-t$, with $0 \le t \le 1$.  Next up, calculating the differential arc length $ds$ is key before I evaluate the integral.


**Calculating Arc Length and Integral**

I've determined that $ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt$. Substituting the parameterization and arc length element, I've set up the definite integral with the correct bounds. My next step involves integrating the expression and then simplifying the result.


**Finalizing the Integration**

I've completed the integration and the substitution of the parameterization into the integral. I've successfully found the antiderivative and evaluated the definite integral with the correct bounds. Now, the final step is to multiply by the constant to get the answer, which I will then verify.


**Outlining the Solution**

I've crafted a comprehensive solution outline, breaking down the problem into manageable steps: parameterization, differential arc length calculation, integral setup, integration, and final answer. I'll make the final solution easy to understand.


**Finalizing Solution Prep**

I'm now writing out the detailed solution in a clear, step-by-step format, as requested. The solution includes the parameterization, calculation of the differential arc length, setting up the integral, performing the integration, and the final answer. I am also double checking the calculations to avoid errors.


**Evaluating the Final Answer**

I'm verifying my solution and numerical results, including the parameterization, arc length calculation, and the integral evaluation, to ensure the final result is accurate and presented correctly. I'm satisfied with the steps and the presentation style.


**Synthesizing the Solution**

I'm now satisfied with the solution. I've broken down each step, verified the calculations and I'm confident about the approach and the final result. I've double checked the work and am ready to present the final answer.


**Reviewing and Refining**

I've carefully reviewed all calculations, confirmed the parameterization, arc length, integral setup, and final integration. I also checked for any simplifying steps that could reduce the complexity of the arithmetic, and verified the answer is both correct and clearly presented. I'm ready to present the final answer now.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral $\int_C x^3 z \, ds$, we need to follow these steps:

**1. Parameterize the path $C$**

The path $C$ is a line segment starting at $P(0, 6, 4)$ and ending at $Q(6, 3, 3)$. We can create a vector equation for the line segment $\mathbf{r}(t)$ where $0 \le t \le 1$:

$$ \mathbf{r}(t) = P + t(Q - P) $$

First, find the direction vector $\mathbf{v} = Q - P$:
$$ \mathbf{v} = \langle 6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4 \rangle = \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle $$

Now, write the parametric equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$:
$$ \mathbf{r}(t) = \langle 0, 6, 4 \rangle + t\langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle $$
$$ x(t) = 6t $$
$$ y(t) = 6 - 3t $$
$$ z(t) = 4 - t $$
Limits for $t$: $0 \le t \le 1$.

**2. Calculate the differential arc length $ds$**

The formula for the differential arc length is $ds = |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, dt$.
First, find the derivative vector $\mathbf{r}'(t)$:
$$ \mathbf{r}'(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\langle 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t \rangle = \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle $$

Next, calculate its magnitude:
$$ |\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} $$
$$ |\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46} $$

So, substituting this back into the expression for $ds$:
$$ ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt $$

**3. Substitute into the integral**

Substitute $x(t)$, $z(t)$, and $ds$ into the integral expression:
$$ \int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_0^1 (6t)^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46} \, dt $$

Simplify the integrand:
$$ (6t)^3 = 216t^3 $$
$$ (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216t^3(4 - t) = 216(4t^3 - t^4) $$

Now the integral becomes:
$$ \int_0^1 216(4t^3 - t^4) \sqrt{46} \, dt $$

**4. Evaluate the integral**

Factor out the constants:
$$ 216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt $$

Calculate the antiderivative:
$$ \int (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt = t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} $$

Evaluate from 0 to 1:
$$ \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left( 1^4 - \frac{1^5}{5} \right) - (0 - 0) $$
$$ = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5} $$

Finally, multiply by the constant term:
$$ 216\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} $$
$$ \frac{216 \cdot 4}{5}\sqrt{46} $$
$$ \frac{864}{5}\sqrt{46} $$

**Answer:**
$$ \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5} $$
