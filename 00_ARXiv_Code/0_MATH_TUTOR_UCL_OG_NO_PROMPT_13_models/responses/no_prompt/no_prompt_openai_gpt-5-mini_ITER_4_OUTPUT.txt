**Calculating the line integral**

I'm computing the line integral ∫_C x^3 z ds for the curve segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). I parameterize it with r(t) and find expressions for x, y, and z. 

The differential ds is derived, and the integral becomes 216 sqrt(46) (4 t^3 - t^4) dt. I integrate from 0 to 1, which simplifies nicely. 

The final answer is (864/5) sqrt(46), and I’ll include the steps for clarity.**Finalizing the numeric solution**

I need to provide the correct final numeric answer and present it nicely. I checked the algebra, and 216 multiplied by 4/5 indeed gives me 864/5, which is accurate. 

I've also noted that orientation doesn't play a role here because the integrand does not involve a vector dot product. 

Alright, I’m ready to return the final solution now, ensuring it's clear and well-formatted for the user.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
Parametrize the segment by
r(t) = (0,6,4) + t(6,-3,-1), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
So x = 6t, z = 4 − t and |r'(t)| = √(6^2+(-3)^2+(-1)^2) = √46. Hence
∫_C x^3 z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)^3(4−t) √46 dt
= 216 √46 ∫_0^1 (4t^3 − t^4) dt
= 216 √46 · (1 − 1/5)
= (864/5) √46.

Answer: (864/5)√46.
