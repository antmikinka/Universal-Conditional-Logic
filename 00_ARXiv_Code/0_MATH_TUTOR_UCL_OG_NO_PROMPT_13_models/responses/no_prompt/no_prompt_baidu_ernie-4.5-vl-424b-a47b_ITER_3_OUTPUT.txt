I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I recall that for a line integral with respect to arc length, ds, I need to parameterize the curve and then use the formula ∫ f(r(t)) |r'(t)| dt over the appropriate interval.

So, step one is to parameterize the line segment from point A(0,6,4) to point B(6,3,3). Let me find a vector from A to B: B - A = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So, the direction vector is (6, -3, -1). I can simplify this by dividing by 3, but it might not be necessary. Actually, for parameterization, it's fine.

Let me define a parameter t such that when t=0, we're at A, and when t=1, we're at B. So, the parametric equations would be:

x = 0 + 6t

y = 6 - 3t

z = 4 - t

Let me check: when t=0, x=0, y=6, z=4 good. When t=1, x=6, y=3, z=3 good.

Now, I need to express ds in terms of dt. ds is the differential arc length, which is |dr/dt| dt, so I need the magnitude of the derivative of the position vector.

So, r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)

Then r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

Now, |r'(t)| = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

It's constant, which makes sense for a straight line.

So, ds = |r'(t)| dt = sqrt(46) dt

Now, the integrand is x^3 z. In terms of t, x = 6t, z = 4 - t

So, f(t) = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

Now, the integral is from t=0 to t=1.

So, ∫_C x^3 z ds = ∫ from 0 to 1 of f(t) |r'(t)| dt = ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) * sqrt(46) dt

I can factor out the constants.

Since sqrt(46) is constant, I can write:

= sqrt(46) ∫_0^1 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 dt

Now, I can factor out 216, but maybe just integrate term by term.

First, ∫ 864 t^3 dt = 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 864/4 t^4 = 216 t^4

∫ t^3 dt = t^4 / 4, so 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4? 864 / 4 = 216, yes.

But there's also -216 t^4, no.

The integral is ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt

So, ∫ 864 t^3 dt = 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4? 864 / 4 = 216, but 216 what? It's 216 t^4, but that's for the first part, but it's minus 216 t^4? No.

Better to compute separately.

Set I = ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt

= 864 ∫ t^3 dt - 216 ∫ t^4 dt from 0 to 1

= 864 [t^4 / 4]_0^1 - 216 [t^5 / 5]_0^1

= 864 * (1/4 - 0) - 216 * (1/5 - 0)

= 864 / 4 - 216 / 5

= 216 - 43.2? Better to compute numerically.

864 / 4 = 216, yes.

216 / 5 = 43.2

But 216 - 43.2 = 172.8, but let's keep fractions.

864 / 4 = 216, but 216 is 216/1, so to subtract, better with common denominator.

I can compute exactly.

First term: 864 * (1/4) = 864/4 = 216

But 216 is an integer? 864 divided by 4 is 216, yes.

But it's minus 216 * (1/5) = 216/5

So overall, 216 - 216/5 = 216 (1 - 1/5) = 216 * (4/5) = 864/5

216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5, yes.

Since both terms have 216, but anyway.

Now, this is the integral before multiplying by sqrt(46).

So I = ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = 864/5 ? No.

I computed ∫ = 216 - 216/5 = 216 * 4/5 = 864/5? 216 * 4 = 864, yes, 864/5.

But 864/5 is 172.8, but let's confirm.

At t=1, t^4=1, t^5=1, but earlier: I have [t^4 /4] from 0 to 1 is 1/4 for first, times 864 is 216.

Second part [t^5 /5] from 0 to 1 is 1/5, times -216 is -216/5.

So 216 - 216/5 = 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5, yes.

But is this correct? I think I missed something. The integral I computed is for the function without the ds component yet. Remember, I have to multiply by sqrt(46).

So, the integral of f(t) dt is I = 864/5? But f(t) is 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, and I integrated that and got 864/5? But 864/5 is approximately 172.8, but let's see the units; but actually, this is just the integral of the function times dt, but in the line integral, I need to multiply by |r'(t)| which is constant.

Recall.

I have ∫ [x^3 z] |dr/dt| dt = ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) * sqrt(46) dt from 0 to 1.

And I computed ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = 864/5

864/5 is 172.8, but that's for the polynomial part.

But 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 at t=1 is 864 - 216 = 648, and integral from 0 to 1 should be less, 864/5=172.8, average maybe around 300 or so, but earlier calculation seems off.

I think I made a mistake. When I computed ∫ 864 t^3 dt from 0 to 1 = 864 * [t^4 /4]_0^1 = 864 * (1/4) = 216, that's correct.

∫ -216 t^4 dt from 0 to 1 = -216 * [t^5 /5]_0^1 = -216 * (1/5) = -216/5

So total integral of f(t) dt is 216 - 0.432? No, -216/5 = -43.2, but in fractions.

216 - 216/5 = as above 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5, yes.

But 864/5 = 172.8

But the function f(t) = x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, at t=0,0; t=1, 216*64? No, (6t)^3 = 216 t^3? 6^3=216, yes, times (4-t) so at t=1, 216*1*(3)=648? Earlier I said 864-216, but 864t^3 at t=1 is 864, minus 216t^4=216, so 864-216=648, but at t=1, x=6, z=3, x^3 z=216*3=648, yes. And at t=0,0, so average value maybe 300, times length 1, so integral around 300, and 172.8 is less, but since it's not linear, the integral is of power functions, which grow slower, but at t=0.5, x=3, z=4-0.5=3.5, x^3=27, so 27*3.5=94.5, and for t^3 part, 864*(0.125)=108, t^4 part -216*(0.0625)= -13.5, so 108-13.5=94.5, yes. Integral from 0 to 1 of 94.5 would be 94.5, but we have varying values, max at some point. Anyway, 172.8 seems reasonable.

But this is ∫ f(t) dt, but I need ∫ f(t) |r'(t)| dt = ∫ f(t) sqrt(46) dt, and |r'(t)| is constant sqrt(46)≈6.782, so 172.8 * 6.782 ≈ let's see, 170*6.8=1156, but I'll compute exactly.

So, the integral is sqrt(46) times the integral I have, but I have ∫ f(t) dt = 864/5

f(t) is x^3 z in terms of t, but I have ∫ f(t) dt = ∫ (864t^3 - 216t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = 864/5? Earlier I said 864/5, but 864/5 is the value, but 864/5 = 172.8, but let's write as fraction.

864/5, but 864 and 5, can simplify? 864÷16=54, no, gcd? 864 and 5, 5 is prime, 864÷5? no, so 864/5.

But actually, 864/5 is correct for ∫ f(t) dt.

But f(t) = x^3 z, which is scalar, and I integrated it with respect to t, but in the line integral, it's ∫ f ds = ∫ f |r'| dt, so I need to multiply by |r'|.

So, total integral = sqrt(46) * (864/5) ? No.

I have ∫ [f(t) |r'(t)|] dt = ∫ f(t) sqrt(46) dt, and I computed ∫ f(t) dt = 864/5, but that's not correct because f(t) dt is what I integrated, but I need to multiply the integral by sqrt(46), no.

Let's clarify.

The integral is ∫_{t=0}^{1} [x(t)^3 z(t)] \cdot | \frac{dr}{dt} | dt = ∫_{0}^{1} [ (6t)^3 (4 - t) ] \cdot \sqrt{46}  dt

Since |r'(t)| is constant.

And [ (6t)^3 (4 - t) ] = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, as before.

So, the integrand is (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt

So, ∫ from 0 to 1 of that dt is \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = \sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5}

Earlier I said ∫ (864t^3 - 216t^4) dt = 864/5? No.

∫ 864 t^3 dt = 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4 from 0 to 1 = 216

∫ -216 t^4 dt = -216 * (t^5 / 5) from 0 to 1 = -216/5

So sum is 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5, yes.

So ∫ = 864/5

Then total integral = \sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5}

But 864/5 is 172.8, but I can simplify.

Notice that in the polynomial, I have 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 t^3 (4 - t)

And 216 is common, but anyway.

So, \sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5}

I can write as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But perhaps simplify fraction.

864 and 5, 5 is prime, 864 not divisible by 5? 864÷5? no, so it's fine, but I can write as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, can I simplify 864/5? No, but perhaps reduce by dividing numerator and denominator, but denominator is 5, numerator 864, no common factors, 864÷16=54, but 5 not divisible, so yes.

Notice that earlier I factored 216, but 864 = 864, 216*4=864, and 216 is 6^3, but perhaps not necessary.

Another way: since r'(t) = (6,-3,-1), |r'|=sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46)

f = x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t)

But I already have it.

Now, the integral is \sqrt{46} \times [ \frac{864}{5} ] but \frac{864}{5} is the integral of f(t) dt, but I need to compute numerically or leave simplified.

Since it's a constant, I can compute the antiderivative.

Let me compute the antiderivative of 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.

Antiderivative is 864 * (t^4 / 4) - 216 * (t^5 / 5) + C = 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 + C

864 / 4 = 216, yes, so 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 + C

Factor 216: 216 ( t^4 - \frac{1}{5} t^5 ) + C

t^4 - (1/5) t^5 = t^4 (1 - t/5) = t^4 ( (5 - t)/5 )

But anyway.

At t=1: 216 (1)^4 - (216/5)(1)^5 = 216 - 216/5 = 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5

At t=0: 0

So yes.

Now multiply by sqrt(46): so total integral is \sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, can this be simplified? 864 and 5 have no common factors, but perhaps reduce by dividing numerator and denominator, but 5 is prime, so no.

Notice that 864 / 2 = 432, but 5 not divisible.

I could write as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But let's check if I can factor.

Another thought: in the beginning, I had direction vector (6,-3,-1), and I took magnitude sqrt(46), but I could have used a different parameterization, but this is fine.

Notice that x from 0 to 6, and z from 4 to 3, but I think I did it correctly.

I can compute numerically to verify.

sqrt(46) ≈ 6.78233

864 / 5 = 172.8

172.8 * 6.78233 ≈ let's see, 170*6.78233 ≈ 170*6.78233, first 100*6.78233=678.233, 70*6.78233≈474.7631, total 1152.9961, better: 172.8 * 6.78233

First, 170 * 6.78233 = 170*6 = 1020, 170*0.78233≈170*0.78=132.6, 170*0.00233≈0.3961, total ≈132.6+0.4=133, so 1020+133=1153? Rough.

172.8 * 6 = 1036.8

172.8 * 0.78233

First, 172.8 * 0.7 = 120.96

172.8 * 0.08 = 13.824

172.8 * 0.002 = 0.3456

172.8 * 0.0003 = 0.05184

172.8 * 0.00003 = very small, negligible

So 120.96 + 13.824 = 134.784

+0.3456 ≈ 135.1296

+0.05184≈135.18144

Now total 1036.8 + 135.18144 = 1171.98144

But earlier I had antiderivative, but this is for the product, but in the integral I have \sqrt{46} times the integral, but the integral I have is 864/5≈172.8, and sqrt(46)≈6.782, product ≈1172, but is this the final answer? I forgot that this is the integral value, but in line integral, it should be a number, but 1172 seems large, but possible.

I could have made a mistake in parameterization.

Another way to parameterize. Sometimes people use length, but not necessary.

Notice that in the expression, I have \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me simplify the fraction. 864 and 5, as said, no common factors. But 864 can be simplified? 864 / 16 = 54, but no denominator.

Notice that in the antiderivative, I have 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5, but earlier I computed at t=1 is 864/5, but that's without sqrt(46).

Total integral is \sqrt{46} times that, so \sqrt{46} \times 864 / 5

But 864 / 5 = 864/5, so \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

I can factor out 216, since 864 = 216 * 4, and 216 is 6^3, but perhaps.

Notice that |r'| = sqrt(46), and the direction vector is (6,-3,-1), magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), yes.

Another way: I can use the formula for line integral.

The total derivative, x' = 6, z' = -1, so ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) dt = sqrt(46) dt, same as before.

And f = x^3 z, so when I substitute, as before.

I can write the integral as \int_0^1 (6t)^3 (4-t) \sqrt{46}  dt

Now, (6t)^3 = 216 t^3, so 216 t^3 (4-t) \sqrt{46} dt = 216 \sqrt{46}  t^3 (4-t) dt

Now, \int_0^1 t^3 (4-t) dt = \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - t^5/5 *4? Wait.

4 \int t^3 dt - \int t^4 dt = 4*(t^4/4) - (t^5/5) |_0^1 = [t^4 - \frac{1}{5} t^5 ]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

Let me compute: \int (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 4*(t^4/4) - (t^5/5) = t^4 - \frac{1}{5} t^5

At t=1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

At t=0: 0, so integral is 4/5.

Then multiplied by 216 \sqrt{46}, so total integral = 216 \sqrt{46} \times \frac{4}{5} = 216 * 4 / 5 * \sqrt{46} = 864 / 5 * \sqrt{46}, same as before.

864 / 5 is 172.8, times sqrt(46)≈6.782, about 1172, but earlier when I computed at points, maximum value of f is about 648, times length? But length of the segment.

What is the length of the segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)? Distance = sqrt( (6-0)^2 + (3-6)^2 + (3-4)^2 ) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46), same as |r'| since |r'|=sqrt(46) and dt from 0 to 1, so length is sqrt(46), about 6.782.

Maximum of f is about 648 at t=1, but average might be lower. Since it's cubic, average value could be around half max or so, but max is 648, and integral should be less than 648 * length ≈ 648 * 6.782 ≈ 4390, and my 1172 is less, but let me see min. At t=0, f=0, at t=0.5, x=3, z=3.5, x^3=27, 27*3.5=94.5, and length? but ds is arc length, but since parameterized by t, and ds proportional to dt, the integral is \int f ds, and ds = sqrt(46) dt, so when I integrate, at t=0.5, ds = constant in this sense? no, ds is constant per dt? no.

In my parameterization, for each dt, ds = |r'| dt, so the integral is sum of f times ds, but ds is the same for each dt interval only if uniform, but here |r'| constant, so ds = |r'| dt, so yes, it's constant step in s only if I scale, but here since |r'| constant, the speed is constant, so for each dt, I cover equal arc length, but f is varying.

At t=0.5, x=3, z=4-0.5=3.5? z=4-t, at t=0.5, z=3.5, x=3, f=x^3 z=27*3.5=94.5

At t=1, f=648

The values: at t=0,0; t=0.5,94.5; t=1,648. It's increasing, so average might be around (0+648)/2=324, but since it's cubic, probably higher, say 400, then integral ≈ 400 * length = 400 * sqrt(46) ≈ 400*6.782=2712.8, but earlier I have 1172, which is less, but at t=0.25, x=6*0.25=1.5, z=4-0.25=3.75, f= (1.5)^3 * 3.75 = 3.375 * 3.75

1.5^2=2.25, *1.5=3.375, yes, 3.375*3.75. 3.375*3=10.125, 3.375*0.75=2.53125, total 12.65625

At t=0.75, x=4.5, z=4-0.75=3.25, f=4.5^3 *3.25= 91.125 * 3.25

4.5^2=20.25, *4.5=91.125, yes. 91.125*3=273.375, 91.125*0.25=22.78125, total 296.15625

So values: t=0:0, t=0.25:12.656, t=0.5:94.5, t=0.75:296.156, t=1:648

So increasing, and from 0 to 648, but average might be say 300, but with higher values towards end. From t=0 to t=1, ds = sqrt(46) dt, so each step dt covers same ds since |r'| constant. So for ds uniform, the values: at s values, but since constant speed, s proportional to t.

The total integral is \int f ds, with ds proportional to dt.

The average of f times ds, but f is not constant.

The integral I have is \int f ds = \int_0^1 f(t) |r'| dt

f(t) at t: as above.

Since ds = |r'| dt, and |r'| = sqrt(46), dt = ds / |r'| , but for integration, same.

Numerically, I can approximate.

Use a few points. Say, with n=2 intervals.

t from 0 to 1, say at t=0, f=0; t=0.5, f=94.5; t=1, f=648

But since it's not discrete, but for Riemann sum.

If I take points at t=0,0.5,1, with Δt=0.5

But for left Riemann sum: at t=0, f=0, times ds? but ds is not Δt.

Better to compute \int f ds ≈ sum f(t_i) Δs_i

But Δs_i = |r'| Δt_i, and if uniform Δt, but since |r'| constant, Δs_i proportional to Δt_i.

In this case, since speed constant, the arc length covered in each interval depends on Δt, but here if I take equal Δt, then each Δt corresponds to same Δs.

Δs = |r'| Δt, so for each Δt, Δs is constant if |r'| constant.

|r'| is constant, so yes, Δs is the same for each interval if Δt is same.

In this case, from t=0 to t=1, if I take two intervals, Δt=0.5, then each interval has Δs = |r'| Δt = sqrt(46)*0.5

Now, for left Riemann sum: at t=0 and t=0.5

f(0)=0, f(0.5)=94.5

So integral ≈ f(0)*Δs + f(0.5)*Δs = 0 + 94.5 * sqrt(46) * 0.5

sqrt(46)≈6.782, so 94.5*6.782*0.5≈94.5*3.391≈94.5*3.4 - 94.5*0.009≈321.3 - 0.8505≈320.4495? Better: 94.5 * 3.391

First, 100*3.391=339.1, minus 5.5*3.391≈5.5*3.4=18.7, but 5.5*3.391=5.5*3.3=18.15, 5.5*0.091=0.5005, total 18.6505, so 339.1 - 18.6505? No, 94.5 = 100 - 5.5, but multiplication: better 94.5 * 3.391

90*3.391=305.19, 4.5*3.391=4*3.391=13.564, 0.5*3.391=1.6955, total 13.564+1.6955=15.2595, so total 305.19+15.2595=320.4495

Then times 1? No, I have [f * Δs] for two intervals, but each has Δs, so for two intervals, but left sum: first interval at t=0, but f(0)=0, so that part is zero. Second interval at t=0.5, f(0.5)=94.5, width Δs = sqrt(46)*0.5 ≈6.782*0.5=3.391, as above. So sum is 0 + 94.5*3.391 ≈ as above 320.4495? But this is for the sum, but I have two intervals? No, in left sum with two intervals, I use left endpoints, so for [0,0.5] at t=0, f=0, so contribution 0. For [0.5,1] at t=0.5, f=94.5, Δs=3.391, so sum is 94.5*3.391 ≈320.4495

But this is for the interval [0.5,1], but the first interval gave zero, so total estimate 320.45

But earlier I thought it should be higher. If I use right Riemann sum: at t=0.5 and t=1 for the two intervals? For interval [0,0.5] right endpoint t=0.5, f=94.5; for [0.5,1] right endpoint t=1, f=648.

So contributions: first interval f(0.5)*Δs = 94.5 * 3.391 ≈320.4495

Second interval f(1)*Δs = 648 * 3.391 ≈ ? 648*3.4=2203.2, minus 648*0.009=5.832, so 2203.2-5.832=2197.368? Messy.

648*3.391: 600*3.391=2034.6, 48*3.391≈48*3.4=163.2 minus 48*0.009=0.432, so 163.2-0.432=162.768, total 2034.6+162.768=2197.368

Then sum: first interval 320.4495 + second 2197.368 = 2517.8175

Now, with my calculated value, \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} ≈ 864 /5 =172.8, times sqrt(46)≈6.78233, so 172.8 * 6.78233

170*6.78233=170*6=1020, 170*0.78233≈132.9961, total 1152.9961

2.8*6.78233≈18.990524

Total ≈1152.9961+18.9905≈1171.9866

Now with two points, right sum gave 2517, left gave 320, but 1171 is between, but since the function is increasing, probably the integral is more than left sum but less than right sum, but 320 is low, 2517 high, 1171 is closer to 320? No, 320 and 2517, average (320+2517)/2=1418.5, and 1171 is less, but perhaps I need more points.

I could add a point.

Use t=0,0.5,1 as before, but for numerical integration, use trapezoidal or something.

The exact value from calculation is 1172, and with two intervals, right sum is 2517, which is larger, but let's compute the exact integral I have for f dt part.

Earlier for ∫ f(t) dt from 0 to 1, f(t)=864t^3 -216t^4, which is 864/5 =172.8, but this is ∫ f dt, but f is x^3 z, which at end is 648, at start 0, and it's positive, so integral should be positive, 172.8 seems reasonable as per earlier calculation.

But ∫ f(t) dt = 172.8, which is the area under x^3 z as function of t, but in terms of the parameter, but for the line integral, I need to multiply by |r'| = sqrt(46) ≈6.782, so 172.8 * 6.782 ≈ let's calculate: 170*6.782 = 1152.94, 2.8*6.782≈19.0, total 1171.94, as before.

Now for the actual integral, since ds = |r'| dt, and f is large at t=1, but t=1 is the end, and ds is fixed per dt, so it should be ok.

I could compute the integral exactly as I did.

Another way: since I have \int_0^1 216 \sqrt{46} t^3 (4-t) dt = 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt

\int_0^1 4t^3 dt = 4* [t^4/4]_0^1 = (1^4 -0) =1? \int 4t^3 dt from 0 to 1 = 4*(1/4) -0 =1? [t^4] from 0 to 1 =1, but 4 times that? \int 4t^3 dt = 4 * (t^4 /4) = t^4 from 0 to 1 =1, yes.

Earlier I said \int 4t^3 dt = but in the expression, it's \int (4t^3 - t^4) dt, so \int 4t^3 dt = [t^4]^{1}_0 =1? No.

\int 4t^3 dt from 0 to 1 = 4 * \int t^3 dt = 4 * [t^4/4]_0^1 =4* (1/4) -0 =1? [t^4/4] at 1 is 1/4, times 4 is 1, yes, but [t^4] at 1 is 1, but \int 4t^3 dt = [4*(t^4/4)] = [t^4] from 0 to 1 =1, yes.

But in the integral, it's \int (4t^3 - t^4) dt, so \int 4t^3 dt - \int t^4 dt = 1 - [t^5/5]_0^1 =1 - 1/5 =4/5, as I had earlier.

So \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 4/5

Then multiply by 216 \sqrt{46}: 216 * \frac{4}{5} * \sqrt{46} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

Same.

Now, 216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5, yes.

Now, so the integral is \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But 864/5 = 172.8, but perhaps I can write as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, simplify: 864 and 5 have no common factors, but 864 can be written as 864 = 144 * 6, but 144=12^2, but with denominator 5, hard to simplify.

Notice that 864 / 5 * sqrt(46) = but perhaps leave as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Or factor: 864 = 864, 5=5.

Divide numerator and denominator, but can't.

Another thought: in the beginning, I used t from 0 to 1, but perhaps I can use the actual arc length parameter, but not necessary.

Notice that the direction vector is (6,-3,-1), and I can use t such that |r'| is incorporated, but same thing.

I could parameterize by arc length. Let s be arc length from A to a point. When s=0 at A, s= length at B. Length = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46) as before.

Then r(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))

Unit vector in direction of (6,-3,-1): magnitude sqrt(46), so unit vector (6/sqrt(46), -3/sqrt(46), -1/sqrt(46))

So from A(0,6,4), so x(s) = 0 + s * 6 / sqrt(46)

y(s) = 6 + s * (-3) / sqrt(46)

z(s) = 4 + s * (-1) / sqrt(46) = 4 - s / sqrt(46)

Now, s from 0 to sqrt(46)

Now ds is just ds, since ds ds = ds, so integral is ∫ [x(s)^3 z(s)] ds from 0 to L, L=sqrt(46)

x(s) = \frac{6s}{\sqrt{46}}

z(s) = 4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}}

So f = [ \frac{6s}{\sqrt{46}} ]^3 [ 4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} ]

= \frac{216 s^3}{\ (46)^{3/2} } [ 4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} ]

( \sqrt{46} )^3 = (46)^{3/2} = (46) * \sqrt{46} = 46 \sqrt{46}

x^3 = [6s / sqrt(46)]^3 = 216 s^3 / (46\sqrt{46}) ? No.

[ a/b ]^3 = a^3 / b^3

b = sqrt(46), so b^3 = (sqrt(46))^3 = (46)^{3/2} = 46 * 46^{1/2} = 46 \sqrt{46}

Yes.

So x^3 = 216 s^3 / (46 \sqrt{46})

But 46 \sqrt{46} = 46^{3/2}, yes.

Now z = 4 - s / sqrt(46)

So f = x^3 z = [216 s^3 / (46 \sqrt{46}) ] * [4 - s / \sqrt{46} ]

= \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} \left( 4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} \right)

Now \frac{216}{46} = \frac{108}{23} , but perhaps keep for now.

Note that \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} is common, but anyway.

So integral = \int_0^{\sqrt{46}} \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} \left( 4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} \right) ds

Let me denote k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{46}}, so z = 4 - k s, but perhaps not.

Factor.

Set u = s / \sqrt{46}, so s = u \sqrt{46}, ds = \sqrt{46} du

When s=0, u=0; s=sqrt(46), u=1.

So integral = \int_0^1 \frac{216 (u \sqrt{46})^3 }{46 \sqrt{46}} \left( 4 - \frac{u \sqrt{46}}{\sqrt{46}} \right) \sqrt{46} du

Simplify inside.

First, (u \sqrt{46})^3 = u^3 * (\sqrt{46})^3 = u^3 * 46^{3/2} = u^3 * 46 \sqrt{46}

Now denominator 46 \sqrt{46}, so \frac{216 u^3 * 46 \sqrt{46} }{46 \sqrt{46}} = 216 u^3

The 46 and \sqrt{46} cancel with denominator.

\frac{46 \sqrt{46}}{46 \sqrt{46}} =1? No.

Numerator: 216 * [u^3 * 46 \sqrt{46}]  (since (s \sqrt{46})^3? s = u \sqrt{46}, so s^3 = (u \sqrt{46})^3 = u^3 * (\sqrt{46})^3 = u^3 * 46^{3/2} = u^3 * (46 \sqrt{46})

Yes.

Denominator: 46 \sqrt{46}

So fraction: \frac{216 \cdot u^3 \cdot 46 \sqrt{46} }{46 \sqrt{46}} = 216 u^3

Exactly! Because 46 \sqrt{46} / (46 \sqrt{46}) =1.

So the fraction simplifies to 216 u^3

Now, the bracket: [4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} ] but s / \sqrt{46} = u, since u = s / \sqrt{46}

So 4 - u

But in the expression, it's multiplied by that, but in the f I have, but here I have the f part times ds, but in the integral, after simplification, I have f ds, but in terms of u.

Recall:

The integrand is f ds, but in the expression above, I have:

After substitution, the integral is:

\int \left[ \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} \left( 4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} \right) \right] ds

But after simplification, the big fraction simplifies to 216 u^3, as above, and then multiplied by [4 - u], but no.

In the expression I have: f ds = [stuff] ds, and after setting s = u \sqrt{46}, ds = \sqrt{46} du

And [stuff] is \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} (4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} )

But as computed, \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} (4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} ) = 216 u^3 (4 - u)

Because after substitution, it simplifies to 216 u^3 (4 - u)

Yes.

Then ds = \sqrt{46} du

But in my earlier simplification, I have only the expression in brackets, but f ds = that times ds, but in the expression above, the [ \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} (4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}} ) ] is actually f? No.

I think I confused.

In the integral, I have ∫ f ds, and I expressed f ds as a function, but after simplification, the entire integrand simplifies.

From above, with u = s / \sqrt{46},

f ds = \left[ \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} \left(4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}}\right) \right] ds

But as we saw, \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} \left(4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}}\right) = 216 u^3 (4 - u) \quad \text{after substituting s = u \sqrt{46} and simplifying}

But actually, since the fraction simplifies to 216 u^3 (4 - u), but this is for the expression before ds? No.

In the expression, the term \frac{216 s^3}{46 \sqrt{46}} \left(4 - \frac{s}{\sqrt{46}}\right) after substituting s = u \sqrt{46}, becomes 216 u^3 (4 - u), as computed.

Then ds = \sqrt{46} du

So f ds = [216 u^3 (4 - u)] \sqrt{46}  du

But earlier I thought f is simplified, but in this, it's f ds, but actually, in terms of u, the integrand is 216 u^3 (4 - u) \sqrt{46}  du

But this is exactly what I had with t parameterization! In fact, same as before with t, since u now is same as t, from 0 to 1.

In my first

==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), parameterize the curve. Let \(t\) range from 0 to 1, with:
\[
x(t) = 6t, \quad y(t) = 6 - 3t, \quad z(t) = 4 - t.
\]
The derivative is \(\mathbf{r}'(t) = (6, -3, -1)\), so the magnitude is:
\[
\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}.
\]
Thus, \(ds = \sqrt{46}  dt\).

The integrand is \(x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4\). The line integral is:
\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt.
\]
Factor out \(\sqrt{46}\):
\[
\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt.
\]
Compute the integral of the polynomial:
\[
\int_0^1 864t^3  dt = 864 \left[ \frac{t^4}{4} \right]_0^1 = 864 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 216,
\]
\[
\int_0^1 (-216t^4)  dt = -216 \left[ \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = -216 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = -\frac{216}{5}.
\]
Summing these:
\[
\int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt = 216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{1080}{5} - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{864}{5}.
\]
Multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\):
\[
\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}.
\]
The fraction \(\frac{864}{5}\) is already simplified, as 864 and 5 have no common factors.

Thus, the value of the line integral is \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\).

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
\]
