Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). Hmm, line integrals with respect to arc length. I remember that for such integrals, we need to parameterize the curve C, then express ds in terms of the parameter, and then substitute everything into the integral. Let me recall the steps.

First, parameterizing a line segment. The general formula for a line segment from point A to point B is r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t goes from 0 to 1. Let's check that. So here, point A is (0, 6, 4) and point B is (6, 3, 3). So the vector from A to B is (6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization should be r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1) where t ∈ [0, 1]. Let's write that out component-wise:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

Yes, that looks right. So x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t, with t from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds. For a parameterized curve, ds = ||r'(t)|| dt. So first, compute the derivative of r(t) with respect to t.

r'(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) = (6, -3, -1)

Then, the magnitude ||r'(t)|| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). Oh, that's a constant, which makes sense because it's a straight line, so the speed is constant.

So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of [x(t)]³ * z(t) * ||r'(t)|| dt.

Let's substitute x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t, and ||r'(t)|| = sqrt(46).

So the integral is ∫₀¹ (6t)³ * (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt.

Let's compute (6t)³ first. 6³ is 216, so (6t)³ = 216 t³. Then multiply by (4 - t):

216 t³ (4 - t) = 216 (4 t³ - t⁴) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴.

So the integral becomes sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt.

Now, let's compute the integral of 864 t³ - 216 t⁴ from 0 to 1.

First, integrate term by term.

∫864 t³ dt = 864 * (t⁴ / 4) = 216 t⁴

∫216 t⁴ dt = 216 * (t⁵ / 5) = (216/5) t⁵

So the integral from 0 to 1 is [216(1)⁴ - (216/5)(1)⁵] - [0 - 0] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5.

Wait, let's check that again. 216 is 1080/5? Because 216 * 5 = 1080, yes. So 1080/5 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Correct.

So the integral inside is 864/5. Then multiply by sqrt(46):

Total integral = sqrt(46) * (864/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Parameterization: Correct. From (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so x goes from 0 to 6, so 6t; y goes from 6 to 3, which is 6 - 3t; z goes from 4 to 3, which is 4 - t. t from 0 to 1. Correct.

2. r'(t) = (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). Correct.

3. x³ z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴. Correct.

4. Integral of that from 0 to 1: ∫0^1 (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt = [216 t⁴ - (216/5) t⁵] from 0 to 1 = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Correct.

5. Multiply by sqrt(46): 864/5 * sqrt(46). That should be the answer.

Let me check if I messed up the exponents. (6t)^3 is 216 t^3, yes. Then multiplied by (4 - t) is 864 t^3 - 216 t^4. Correct.

Integral of t^3 is t^4/4, so 864*(t^4/4) = 216 t^4. Integral of t^4 is t^5/5, so 216*(t^5/5). So evaluated at 1, it's 216 - 216/5 = 864/5. Correct.

Then multiplied by sqrt(46). So the final answer is (864 sqrt(46))/5.

I think that's it. Let me just make sure there are no calculation errors. 6 squared is 36, (-3)^2 is 9, (-1)^2 is 1, sum is 46, square root of 46. Correct. The parameterization is linear, so the derivative is constant, which makes ds a constant multiple of dt, which simplifies the integral. All steps seem correct.

**Final Answer**
The value of the line integral is \(\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}\).


==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral  
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds
$$  
where $ C $ is the line segment from $ (0, 6, 4) $ to $ (6, 3, 3) $, we proceed by parameterizing the curve and computing the integral using standard techniques for line integrals with respect to arc length.

### **Step 1: Parameterize the Curve**

We define a parameterization of the line segment from point $ A = (0, 6, 4) $ to point $ B = (6, 3, 3) $. The direction vector is:
$$
\vec{v} = B - A = (6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4) = (6, -3, -1)
$$

So the parameterization is:
$$
\vec{r}(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1), \quad t \in [0, 1]
$$

This gives:
$$
x(t) = 6t, \quad y(t) = 6 - 3t, \quad z(t) = 4 - t
$$

---

### **Step 2: Compute $ ds $**

The differential arc length element is given by:
$$
ds = \|\vec{r}'(t)\| dt
$$

Compute the derivative:
$$
\vec{r}'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
$$

Then:
$$
\|\vec{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}
$$

Thus:
$$
ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt
$$

---

### **Step 3: Substitute into the Integral**

Now substitute $ x(t) = 6t $, $ z(t) = 4 - t $, and $ ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt $ into the integral:

$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_0^1 (6t)^3 (4 - t) \cdot \sqrt{46} \, dt
$$

Simplify:
$$
(6t)^3 = 216 t^3 \Rightarrow \text{Integral becomes } \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 t^3 (4 - t) \, dt
$$

Distribute:
$$
216 t^3 (4 - t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4
$$

So the integral becomes:
$$
\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) \, dt
$$

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate the Integral**

Break it into two parts:
$$
\int_0^1 864 t^3 \, dt = 864 \cdot \left[ \frac{t^4}{4} \right]_0^1 = 864 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 216
$$
$$
\int_0^1 216 t^4 \, dt = 216 \cdot \left[ \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \frac{216}{5}
$$

Subtract:
$$
216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{1080 - 216}{5} = \frac{864}{5}
$$

Multiply by $ \sqrt{46} $:
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
$$
