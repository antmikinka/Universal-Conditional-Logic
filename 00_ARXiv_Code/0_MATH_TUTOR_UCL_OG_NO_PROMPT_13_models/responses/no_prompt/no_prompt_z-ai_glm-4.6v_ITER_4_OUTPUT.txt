Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to recall how to compute a line integral of the form ∫_C f(x, y, z) ds, where C is a line segment. The general approach is to parameterize the curve C, express x, y, z in terms of a parameter (like t), find the differential ds in terms of dt, and then integrate over the parameter interval.

First, let's find the parametric equations for the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). The vector from the initial point to the terminal point is (6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4) = (6, -3, -1). So, we can parameterize the line segment using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The parametric equations would be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t  
y(t) = 6 + (-3)t = 6 - 3t  
z(t) = 4 + (-1)t = 4 - t  

Now, we need to find ds. The formula for ds in terms of t is ds = √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²] dt. Let's compute the derivatives:

dx/dt = 6  
dy/dt = -3  
dz/dt = -1  

So, (dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)² = 6² + (-3)² + (-1)² = 36 + 9 + 1 = 46. Therefore, ds = √46 dt.

Now, the integrand is x³ z. Let's express x³ z in terms of t. x(t) = 6t, so x³ = (6t)³ = 216t³. z(t) = 4 - t. So, x³ z = 216t³(4 - t) = 216t³(4) - 216t³(t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴.

Now, the line integral becomes the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * √46 dt. Since √46 is a constant, we can factor it out:

√46 ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt

Let's compute the integral inside. First, integrate term by term:

∫864t³ dt = 864 * (t⁴/4) = 216t⁴  
∫216t⁴ dt = 216 * (t⁵/5) = (216/5)t⁵  

So, the integral from 0 to 1 is [216(1)⁴ - (216/5)(1)⁵] - [216(0)⁴ - (216/5)(0)⁵] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5.

Now, multiply by √46:

√46 * (864/5) = (864√46)/5.

Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure. Let's verify the parametric equations. The initial point is (0,6,4) when t=0, and terminal point (6,3,3) when t=1. So x(t)=6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t. That's correct. Then dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1. Squared terms: 36 + 9 + 1 = 46, so ds=√46 dt. Correct.

Integrand: x³ z = (6t)³*(4 - t) = 216t³*(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴. Correct.

Integral of 864t³ from 0 to 1: 864*(1/4) = 216. Integral of 216t⁴ from 0 to 1: 216*(1/5) = 216/5. So 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by √46: 864√46/5. That seems right. Let me check if I made a mistake in the parameterization or the derivatives. No, the parameterization is standard for a line segment: r(t) = r0 + t(r1 - r0), where r0 is the initial point and r1 is the terminal point. So that's correct. The derivatives are correct, ds is correctly calculated. The integrand substitution is correct. The integral calculation is correct. So the final answer should be 864√46/5.

To solve the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z \, ds\) where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), follow these steps:


### Step 1: Parameterize the Line Segment  
The line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\) can be parameterized using a parameter \(t \in [0, 1]\):  
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t)
\]  
Thus, the parametric equations are:  
\[
x(t) = 6t, \quad y(t) = 6 - 3t, \quad z(t) = 4 - t
\]  


### Step 2: Compute \(ds\)  
The differential arc length \(ds\) is given by:  
\[
ds = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]  
Compute the derivatives:  
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 6, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = -3, \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = -1
\]  
Substitute into the formula for \(ds\):  
\[
ds = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} \, dt = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} \, dt = \sqrt{46} \, dt
\]  


### Step 3: Substitute \(x\), \(z\), and \(ds\) into the Integral  
The integrand \(x^3 z\) becomes:  
\[
x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4
\]  
Thus, the line integral transforms to:  
\[
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \cdot \sqrt{46} \, dt
\]  


### Step 4: Evaluate the Integral  
Factor out the constant \(\sqrt{46}\) and integrate term-by-term:  
\[
\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \, dt = \sqrt{46} \left[ 864 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1
\]  
Simplify the antiderivative:  
\[
864 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} = 216t^4, \quad 216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} = \frac{216}{5}t^5
\]  
Evaluate from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 1\):  
\[
\sqrt{46} \left[ \left(216(1)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(1)^5\right) - \left(216(0)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(0)^5\right) \right] = \sqrt{46} \left( 216 - \frac{216}{5} \right)
\]  
Simplify the expression inside the brackets:  
\[
216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{1080}{5} - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{864}{5}
\]  


### Step 5: Final Result  
Multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\):  
\[
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}
\]  


The value of the line integral is \(\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}\).
