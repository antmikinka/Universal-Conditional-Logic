**Evaluating line integral**

I need to parse a problem that involves evaluating the line integral ∫_C x^3 z ds along a line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). The scalar line integral over the curve's arc length can be set up as ∫ f(x,y,z) ds, where f = x^3 z. I'll parametrize the line as r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t in [0,1]. This gives me x = 6t and z = 4 - t, but also I need to compute ds = |r'(t)| dt with r' = (6, -3, -1). The norm ends up being sqrt(46).**Calculating the integral**

For the integral ∫_0^1 (x^3 z) * |r'| dt, it works out to be sqrt(46) ∫_0^1 ( (6t)^3 * (4 - t) ) dt. This simplifies to sqrt(46) times the integral of (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt, which I can compute easily. After evaluating, I find it results in (864/5) sqrt(46). If needed for exact values, I can also provide numerical approximations—about 1171.8 when calculated. However, I can present the results succinctly without over-complication.**Finalizing the integral calculation**

I want to be careful about the calculation—there's also a way to parametrize by arclength, but the previous approach works fine. I need to show the integrand and the steps clearly. Ultimately, the final answer will be (864/5) sqrt(46). I’ll ensure that my final message is concise while still providing all the necessary details for clarity. Keeping it straightforward will help the user grasp the process better!

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
Parametrize the segment by
r(t) = (0,6,4) + t((6,3,3)-(0,6,4)) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Then r'(t) = (6, -3, -1) and |r'(t)| = sqrt(36+9+1) = sqrt(46).

x = 6t, z = 4 - t, so
∫_C x^3 z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)^3(4-t) |r'(t)| dt
= sqrt(46) ∫_0^1 216 t^3(4-t) dt
= sqrt(46) ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt
= sqrt(46) [216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5]_0^1
= sqrt(46) (216 - 216/5)
= (864/5) sqrt(46).

So the value is (864/5)·√46.
