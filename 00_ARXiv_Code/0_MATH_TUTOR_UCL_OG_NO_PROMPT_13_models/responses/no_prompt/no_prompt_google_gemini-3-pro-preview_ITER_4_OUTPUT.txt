**Defining the Task at Hand**

I've got the gist of it now. The user wants the line integral calculated. My focus is on the math itself, specifically, formulating an approach to solve the problem by evaluating that line integral. I need to figure out which approach is best for this specific equation.


**Mapping the Solution Path**

I'm deep in the process. Now, I'm focusing on the plan. First, the curve needs parameterization. Then, I need to figure out *ds*. That's the arc length element. After that, I will substitute everything into the integral to solve the problem.


**Implementing the Plan Now**

I'm making progress, now working to find the parameterization. I found a vector equation. Subsequently, the derivatives and the arc length element are worked out. My next task involves substituting the results into the integral. Then, I need to evaluate the definite integral.


**Completing the Calculation**

I'm wrapping up the final steps. I've successfully parameterized the curve, calculated *ds*, and performed the substitution. Now I'm focused on the definite integral, working through each step carefully. I am very close to the final answer.


**Summarizing the Approach**

I'm now fully immersed in the problem, and have a clear strategy. The plan is laid out, consisting of parameterizing the curve, finding the arc length, substituting values, and finally, solving the integral. I've also re-checked the calculations and reviewed the final answer.


**Calculating the Integral's Value**

I'm now fully immersed in the problem, and have a clear strategy. I've re-examined and confirmed every step of the computation, ensuring the parameterization, *ds* calculation, and substitution are accurate. Then I evaluated the integral and double-checked the final answer one last time. Now I am formulating the final response.


**Preparing the Response**

I'm ready to craft the answer, ensuring clarity and precision. I'll include all the detailed steps for a thorough explanation. First, I'll formulate the introduction by restating the problem and setting up the equation, and I will be sure to use LaTeX format for the math.




==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral $\int_C x^3 z \, ds$, we need to follow these steps:

1.  **Parameterize the path $C$**: Find parametric equations for the line segment connecting the two given points.
2.  **Calculate the arc length differential $ds$**: Determine the magnitude of the derivative of the position vector.
3.  **Substitute and Evaluate**: Convert the integral into terms of the parameter $t$ and compute the definite integral.

**Step 1: Parameterize the curve $C$**

The curve $C$ is the line segment from point $P_0(0, 6, 4)$ to point $P_1(6, 3, 3)$.
We can parameterize a line segment between two points $\mathbf{r}_0$ and $\mathbf{r}_1$ using the formula:
$$\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{r}_0 + t(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \quad \text{for } 0 \le t \le 1$$

Substitute the given points:
$$\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle 0, 6, 4 \rangle + t(\langle 6, 3, 3 \rangle - \langle 0, 6, 4 \rangle)$$
$$\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle 0, 6, 4 \rangle + t\langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle$$
$$\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t \rangle$$

From this, our parametric equations are:
*   $x(t) = 6t$
*   $y(t) = 6 - 3t$
*   $z(t) = 4 - t$

**Step 2: Calculate the differential $ds$**

The differential with respect to arc length, $ds$, is given by:
$$ds = |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, dt$$

First, find the derivative vector $\mathbf{r}'(t)$:
$$\mathbf{r}'(t) = \langle \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt} \rangle = \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle$$

Next, find its magnitude:
$$|\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2}$$
$$|\mathbf{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}$$

So,
$$ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt$$

**Step 3: Substitute and Evaluate the Integral**

Now substitute $x(t)$, $z(t)$, and $ds$ into the original integral. The integrand is $x^3 z$.

*   $x^3 = (6t)^3 = 216t^3$
*   $z = 4 - t$
*   $x^3 z = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4$

The integral becomes:
$$ \int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_{0}^{1} (864t^3 - 216t^4) \sqrt{46} \, dt $$

Factor out the constant $\sqrt{46}$:
$$ = \sqrt{46} \int_{0}^{1} (864t^3 - 216t^4) \, dt $$

Evaluate the antiderivative term by term:
$$ = \sqrt{46} \left[ 864 \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_{0}^{1} $$
$$ = \sqrt{46} \left[ 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 \right]_{0}^{1} $$

Apply the limits of integration (from 0 to 1):
$$ = \sqrt{46} \left( \left( 216(1)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(1)^5 \right) - (0 - 0) \right) $$
$$ = \sqrt{46} \left( 216 - \frac{216}{5} \right) $$

Factor out 216:
$$ = 216 \sqrt{46} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{5} \right) $$
$$ = 216 \sqrt{46} \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) $$

Multiply the numbers:
$$ = \frac{216 \cdot 4 \cdot \sqrt{46}}{5} $$
$$ = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} $$

**Answer:**
The value of the line integral is **$\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}$**.
