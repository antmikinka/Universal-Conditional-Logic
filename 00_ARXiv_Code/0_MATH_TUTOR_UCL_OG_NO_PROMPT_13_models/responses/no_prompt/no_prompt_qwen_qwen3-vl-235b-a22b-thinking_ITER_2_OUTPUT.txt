Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). Hmm, line integrals with respect to arc length. I remember that to compute such integrals, we need to parameterize the curve C, then express ds in terms of the parameter, and then integrate over the parameter interval.

First, let's recall that for a line segment between two points, we can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. Let's denote the starting point as P₀ = (0,6,4) and the ending point as P₁ = (6,3,3). The vector from P₀ to P₁ is P₁ - P₀ = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So a parameterization r(t) of the line segment can be written as r(t) = P₀ + t(P₁ - P₀) where t ∈ [0,1].

Let me write that out: r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t). So x(t) = 6t, y(t) = 6 - 3t, z(t) = 4 - t. That seems right. Now, ds is the arc length element, which is |r'(t)| dt. So I need to compute the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, find its magnitude, and then multiply by dt to get ds.

Let's compute r'(t). The derivative of x(t) is 6, derivative of y(t) is -3, derivative of z(t) is -1. So r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). Then the magnitude |r'(t)| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). Oh, that's a constant, which makes sense because it's a straight line, so the speed is constant.

So ds = |r'(t)| dt = sqrt(46) dt. Now, the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of [x(t)]³ z(t) * |r'(t)| dt. Let's substitute x(t) and z(t) in terms of t.

x(t) = 6t, so [x(t)]³ = (6t)³ = 216 t³. z(t) = 4 - t. So the integrand becomes 216 t³ (4 - t) * sqrt(46). Since sqrt(46) is a constant, we can factor that out of the integral.

So the integral is sqrt(46) * 216 ∫ from 0 to 1 of t³ (4 - t) dt. Let's compute the integral inside first. Let's expand t³ (4 - t) = 4t³ - t⁴. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Integrating term by term: ∫4t³ dt = 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴, and ∫-t⁴ dt = - (t⁵)/5. So evaluating from 0 to 1: [t⁴ - (t⁵)/5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5.

So the integral inside is 4/5. Then the entire integral is sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5). Let's compute that. 216 * 4 = 864, so 864/5 * sqrt(46). Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, let's verify each step. First, parameterization: yes, r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t from 0 to 1. Correct. Then r'(t) = (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). Correct. Then x³ z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Correct. Then ds = sqrt(46) dt. So the integral is ∫₀¹ 216 t³ (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt. Factor out constants: 216 sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt. The integral of 4t³ is t⁴, integral of t⁴ is t⁵/5, so from 0 to 1, it's 4*(1/4) - 1/5 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Wait, 4t³ integrated is 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴, so evaluated at 1 is 1, at 0 is 0. Then -t⁴ integrated is -t⁵/5, so evaluated at 1 is -1/5, at 0 is 0. So total is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

So 216 * 4/5 = (216*4)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by sqrt(46), so the final result is (864/5) sqrt(46). Let me check if 864 and 5 can be simplified, but 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, but since it's a fraction, 864/5 is fine. So the line integral is (864√46)/5.

I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the parameterization. The line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3): when t=0, r(0) = (0,6,4), correct. When t=1, r(1) = (6, 3, 3), correct. The derivatives are correct, magnitude is sqrt(46), correct. The integrand substitution is correct. The integration is correct. So yes, the answer should be (864√46)/5.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral  
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds
$$  
where $ C $ is the line segment from $ (0, 6, 4) $ to $ (6, 3, 3) $, we proceed as follows:

---

### **Step 1: Parameterize the Curve**

We parameterize the line segment using a parameter $ t \in [0, 1] $ such that:
$$
\vec{r}(t) = (1 - t)(0, 6, 4) + t(6, 3, 3)
$$
This gives:
$$
x(t) = 6t,\quad y(t) = 6 - 3t,\quad z(t) = 4 - t
$$

---

### **Step 2: Compute $ ds $**

The arc length element $ ds $ is given by:
$$
ds = |\vec{r}'(t)| \, dt
$$
Compute the derivative of $ \vec{r}(t) $:
$$
\vec{r}'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
$$
Then:
$$
|\vec{r}'(t)| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}
$$
So:
$$
ds = \sqrt{46} \, dt
$$

---

### **Step 3: Substitute into the Integral**

Now express the integrand in terms of $ t $:
- $ x(t) = 6t \Rightarrow x^3 = (6t)^3 = 216t^3 $
- $ z(t) = 4 - t $

Thus:
$$
x^3 z = 216t^3 (4 - t)
$$

Substitute into the integral:
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_0^1 216t^3 (4 - t) \cdot \sqrt{46} \, dt
$$

Factor out constants:
$$
= 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt
$$

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate the Integral**

Break the integral into two parts:
$$
\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt = \int_0^1 4t^3 \, dt - \int_0^1 t^4 \, dt
$$
$$
= \left[ t^4 \right]_0^1 - \left[ \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Final Computation**

Multiply the result by the constants:
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = 216 \sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
$$
