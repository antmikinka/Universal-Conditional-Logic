Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). Hmm, line integrals of scalar functions... I remember that for a line integral with respect to arc length, ds, we can parameterize the curve C, express x, y, z in terms of a parameter t, and then convert ds into dt using the derivative of the parameterization.

First, let's parameterize the line segment. A line segment from point A to point B can be parameterized as r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t goes from 0 to 1. Let's check that. Here, A is (0, 6, 4) and B is (6, 3, 3). So the vector from A to B is (6 - 0, 3 - 6, 3 - 4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parameterization should be:

r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), where t ∈ [0, 1].

Let me confirm: when t = 0, we get (0, 6, 4), which is A. When t = 1, we get (6, 3, 3), which is B. Perfect.

Now, for a line integral ∫_C f(x, y, z) ds, the formula is ∫_{t=a}^{t=b} f(r(t)) ||r'(t)|| dt, where ||r'(t)|| is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t).

First, let's find r'(t). The derivative of r(t) with respect to t is (6, -3, -1). So r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). Then the magnitude ||r'(t)|| is √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46. That's a constant, which makes sense because it's a straight line, so the speed is constant.

Next, we need to express f(x, y, z) = x³ z in terms of t. Since x = 6t and z = 4 - t, then x³ z = (6t)³ (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216(4t³ - t⁴).

So now, the integral becomes ∫_{t=0}^{t=1} [216(4t³ - t⁴)] * √46 dt. Since √46 and 216 are constants, we can factor them out:

216 √46 ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Let's compute the integral inside. The integral of 4t³ is 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴, and the integral of t⁴ is t⁵/5. So:

∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - t⁵/5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5.

Therefore, the entire integral is 216 √46 * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) √46 = (864 / 5) √46.

Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, parameterization: correct. r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), t from 0 to 1. Then r'(t) = (6, -3, -1), magnitude √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46. Correct.

f(r(t)) = x³ z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Correct.

Then ds = ||r'(t)|| dt = √46 dt. So the integral is ∫₀¹ 216 t³ (4 - t) * √46 dt = 216 √46 ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Integrating 4t³ gives t⁴, integrating t⁴ gives t⁵/5, so evaluated from 0 to 1: (1 - 1/5) = 4/5. Correct.

216 * 4/5 = 864/5. So the integral is (864/5) √46. That seems right.

Let me just verify the arithmetic: 216 * 4 is 864, divided by 5 is 864/5. Yep. And √46 is just a constant factor. So the final answer should be (864√46)/5.

I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any steps. The key steps are parameterizing the curve, finding the derivative to get ds, substituting the parameterization into the function, and then integrating over t. Everything checks out. So the line integral is 864√46 divided by 5.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral  
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds
$$  
where $ C $ is the line segment from $ (0, 6, 4) $ to $ (6, 3, 3) $, we proceed by parameterizing the curve and applying the standard formula for a scalar line integral.

### **Step 1: Parameterize the Curve**

The line segment from point $ A = (0, 6, 4) $ to point $ B = (6, 3, 3) $ can be parameterized as:
$$
\vec{r}(t) = A + t(B - A) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1)
$$
$$
\Rightarrow \vec{r}(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), \quad t \in [0, 1]
$$

---

### **Step 2: Compute $ \|\vec{r}'(t)\| $**

Differentiate $ \vec{r}(t) $ with respect to $ t $:
$$
\vec{r}'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
$$
Then compute the magnitude:
$$
\|\vec{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Express the Integrand in Terms of $ t $**

We are given the integrand $ f(x, y, z) = x^3 z $. Substituting $ x = 6t $ and $ z = 4 - t $, we get:
$$
f(\vec{r}(t)) = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216(4t^3 - t^4)
$$

---

### **Step 4: Set Up the Integral**

Using the formula for a scalar line integral:
$$
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_0^1 f(\vec{r}(t)) \cdot \|\vec{r}'(t)\| \, dt
$$
Substitute the expressions:
$$
= \int_0^1 216(4t^3 - t^4) \cdot \sqrt{46} \, dt = 216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt
$$

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate the Integral**

Compute the definite integral:
$$
\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = (1 - \frac{1}{5}) - (0 - 0) = \frac{4}{5}
$$

Now multiply:
$$
216\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
$$
