=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The user wants me to evaluate the integral of x cubed times z ds over the curve C, which is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I need to parameterize the line segment C. Since it's a straight line, I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for a line segment between two points (x₀,y₀,z₀) and (x₁,y₁,z₁) is r(t) = (x₀ + t(x₁ - x₀), y₀ + t(y₁ - y₀), z₀ + t(z₁ - z₀)). 

So plugging in the given points: starting at (0,6,4) and ending at (6,3,3). The differences in each coordinate are 6-0=6 for x, 3-6=-3 for y, and 3-4=-1 for z. So the parameterization should be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t
y(t) = 6 - 3t
z(t) = 4 - t

Next, I need to find ds, which is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, times dt. So first, compute r'(t):

dx/dt = 6
dy/dt = -3
dz/dt = -1

Then the magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x(t), z(t), and ds into the integral. The integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [ (6t)^3 * (4 - t) ] * sqrt(46) dt.

Let me simplify the integrand. First, (6t)^3 is 216t³. Multiply that by (4 - t): 216t³*(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴. Then multiply by sqrt(46):

Integral = sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt

Now integrate term by term:

∫864t³ dt = 864*(t⁴/4) = 216t⁴
∫216t⁴ dt = 216*(t⁵/5) = (216/5)t⁵

Evaluate from 0 to 1:

At t=1: 216*(1)^4 - (216/5)*(1)^5 = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5

Multiply by sqrt(46):

Integral = sqrt(46) * (864/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46)

Wait, let me check the calculations again. 864 divided by 4 is 216, correct. 216 divided by 5 is 43.2, but as a fraction, 216/5. Then 216 - 216/5 is (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Yes. Then multiplied by sqrt(46). So the final answer is (864√46)/5.

Now, converting this into TTS format. The problem is a line integral in vector calculus. The question type is a calculation problem. The math content check is yes.

In the TTS transformation, the coordinates need to be read with commas. The integral is a single answer. The scratchwork should have the steps verbalized.

For the main answer: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths square root of forty-six"

For the scratchwork steps:

1. Parameterize the line segment from zero comma six comma four to six comma three comma three using t from zero to one.
2. The parameterization is x equals six t comma y equals six minus three t comma z equals four minus t.
3. Compute the derivative components: dx dt equals six comma dy dt equals negative three comma dz dt equals negative one.
4. The magnitude of the derivative is square root of six squared plus negative three squared plus negative one squared equals square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one equals square root of forty-six.
5. Substitute into the integral: integral from t equals zero to one of open parenthesis six t close parenthesis cubed times open parenthesis four minus t close parenthesis times square root of forty-six d t.
6. Simplify the integrand: six cubed is two hundred sixteen so two hundred sixteen t cubed times open parenthesis four minus t close parenthesis equals eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth power.
7. Multiply by square root of forty-six and integrate term by term from zero to one.
8. The integral of eight hundred sixty-four t cubed is two hundred sixteen t to the fourth power evaluated from zero to one equals two hundred sixteen.
9. The integral of two hundred sixteen t to the fourth power is two hundred sixteen fifths t to the fifth power evaluated from zero to one equals two hundred sixteen fifths.
10. Subtract to get two hundred sixteen minus two hundred sixteen fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths.
11. Multiply by square root of forty-six to get the final result.

Need to make sure all commas are vocalized, especially in coordinates and steps. The JSON should have the problem statement in natural language, no math symbols.
