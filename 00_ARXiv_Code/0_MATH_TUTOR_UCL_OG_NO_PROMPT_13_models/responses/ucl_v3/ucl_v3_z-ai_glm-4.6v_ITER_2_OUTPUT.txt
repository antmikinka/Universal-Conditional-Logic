=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Let me analyze this problem step by step.

The problem asks to evaluate the line integral:
∫_C x³z ds

Where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3).

To solve this, I need to:
1. Parameterize the line segment C
2. Find the differential arc length ds
3. Substitute into the integral and evaluate

Step 1: Parameterize the line segment
The line segment goes from point A(0, 6, 4) to point B(6, 3, 3).

I can parameterize this line segment using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1:
r(t) = A + t(B - A)
r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1)
r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t)

So:
x = 6t
y = 6 - 3t  
z = 4 - t

Step 2: Find ds
ds = |r'(t)| dt

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
|r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

So ds = √46 dt

Step 3: Set up and evaluate the integral
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4 - t) √46 dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 216t³(4 - t) dt
= 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt
= 216√46 [4(t⁴/4) - t⁵/5]_0^1
= 216√46 [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1
= 216√46 [1 - 1/5]
= 216√46 [4/5]
= (864/5)√46

Let me double-check this calculation:
∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5

So the final answer is (864/5)√46.
