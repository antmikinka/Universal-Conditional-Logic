=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). Hmm, line integrals with respect to arc length. I remember that to evaluate these, we need to parameterize the curve C.

First, I need to find a parametric equation for the line segment. The general formula for a line segment from point A to point B is r(t) = A + t(B - A) where t goes from 0 to 1. Let's compute the direction vector.

Point A is (0, 6, 4), and point B is (6, 3, 3). So the vector from A to B is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Therefore, the parameterization should be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

for t in [0, 1].

Next, I need to compute ds. For a parameterized curve, ds = ||r'(t)|| dt. Let's find the derivative of r(t).

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x(t), z(t), and ds into the integral. The integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [x(t)]³ * z(t) * ||r'(t)|| dt.

Plugging in:

x(t) = 6t, so x³ = (6t)³ = 216 t³

z(t) = 4 - t

||r'(t)|| = sqrt(46)

So the integrand is 216 t³ * (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt.

Let me write that out:

216 * sqrt(46) * ∫ from 0 to 1 of t³ (4 - t) dt

Multiply out the terms inside the integral: 4t³ - t⁴.

So the integral becomes 216 sqrt(46) [ ∫0^1 4t³ dt - ∫0^1 t⁴ dt ]

Compute each integral:

∫4t³ dt from 0 to1 is 4*(t⁴/4) evaluated from 0 to1 = [t⁴] from 0 to1 = 1 - 0 =1

∫t⁴ dt from 0 to1 is t⁵/5 evaluated from 0 to1 = 1/5 -0 =1/5

So the difference is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

Therefore, the entire expression is 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46)

Wait, let me check the arithmetic again. 216 *4 = 864, over 5. So 864/5 sqrt(46). Is that right?

Wait, 216 * 4/5 = (216*4)/5 = 864/5. Yes. So the final answer is (864/5)√46.

Let me verify the steps again to be sure.

Parameterization: correct. Direction vector (6, -3, -1), so x=6t, y=6-3t, z=4-t. Correct.

r'(t) is (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36 +9 +1)=sqrt(46). Correct.

x³ z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Correct.

Integral becomes ∫0^1 216 t³ (4 - t) sqrt(46) dt. Factor out constants: 216 sqrt(46) ∫0^1 (4t³ - t^4) dt.

Integral of 4t³ is t^4, evaluated from 0 to1 is 1. Integral of t^4 is 1/5. So 4*(1) - 1/5? Wait no: 4t³ integrates to 4*(t^4/4)=t^4, so from 0 to1 is 1. Then minus integral t^4 which is 1/5. So total 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

So 216 * 4/5 = 864/5. Multiply by sqrt(46). So yes, 864/5 √46.

I think that's correct. Let me just make sure there are no calculation errors. 6^3 is 216, yes. 4t^3 - t^4 integrated from 0 to1: [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to1 = (1 - 1/5) -0 =4/5. Correct. So the answer is 864√46 /5.

Yes, that seems right.
