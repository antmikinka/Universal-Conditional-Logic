=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to remember how to compute a line integral over a line segment. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I should parameterize the line segment. Let's denote the start point as P0 = (0,6,4) and the end point as P1 = (6,3,3). The parameterization of a line segment from P0 to P1 is usually r(t) = P0 + t(P1 - P0) where t goes from 0 to 1. 

So let's compute the vector from P0 to P1: P1 - P0 = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Then the parameterization r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t ∈ [0,1]. 

Next, we need to find ds, which is the arc length element. For a parameterized curve r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), ds = √[(x’(t))² + (y’(t))² + (z’(t))²] dt. Let's compute the derivatives: x’(t) = 6, y’(t) = -3, z’(t) = -1. Then the magnitude of the derivative vector is √[6² + (-3)² + (-1)²] = √[36 + 9 + 1] = √46. So ds = √46 dt.

Now, substitute x(t) and z(t) into the integrand. x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t. So the integrand x³z becomes (6t)³(4 - t) = 216t³(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴.

Now the line integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * √46 dt. Since √46 is a constant, we can factor it out: √46 ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt.

Let's compute the integral of 864t³: 864*(t⁴/4) = 216t⁴. The integral of -216t⁴: -216*(t⁵/5) = -216t⁵/5. Evaluate from 0 to 1: [216(1)⁴ - 216(1)⁵/5] - [0 - 0] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5.

Then multiply by √46: (864/5)√46. Let's check if that can be simplified. 864 and 5 have no common factors, so that's the result. Wait, let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Parameterization: Correct, since from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), the direction vector is (6,-3,-1), so r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t) is right. Derivatives: x’=6, y’=-3, z’=-1, magnitude √(36+9+1)=√46, correct. Integrand: x³z = (6t)³(4-t) = 216t³(4-t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴, correct. Integral of 864t³ from 0 to 1: 864*(1/4)=216, integral of -216t⁴: -216*(1/5)=-216/5, so 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5, correct. Then multiply by √46: 864√46/5. That seems right.
