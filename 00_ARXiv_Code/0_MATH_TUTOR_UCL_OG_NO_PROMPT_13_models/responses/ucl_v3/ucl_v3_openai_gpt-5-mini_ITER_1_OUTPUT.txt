**Calculating an integral result**

I’m working through an integral for the function x^3 z ds, which leads me to compute some symbolic parts. After integrating and simplifying, I’ve reached a numeric expression. The result is (864/5) times the square root of 46. Now, I need to express this in a way that’s clear for speech. They want me to avoid mathematical symbols, so I’ll describe it solely in natural language, making sure to include verbal cues like saying “comma” explicitly in coordinates.**Formatting final answers**

I’m focusing on the final answers which need to be in a spoken format. I should say it like, “eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six.” They have specific rules, like using "numerator over denominator" for fractions. I must avoid any mathematical symbols in the output. Also, for scratchwork answers, I want to include step-by-step details in spoken language, which might involve using phrases like "the quantity" and paying attention to the structure and nesting depth.**Structuring our narration**

I’m trying to navigate how to use directives for narrating math content properly. For example, I need to use "the quantity" for expressions like “a sub two minus p sub one end quantity,” but this is specific to Gram-Schmidt, and here QR is not relevant. I must also ensure to apply explicit separators like commas. Regarding the JSON template, since I can't find a problem number, I might set that as an empty string. The question type seems to lean toward "line_integral", and the final answer should include "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six," ensuring clear multiplication in narration.**Refining spoken expressions**

I’m considering how to phrase the final answer clearly. I have options like "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six" or "eight hundred sixty-four divided by five times the square root of forty-six." The guideline specifies using "numerator over denominator" for fractions, so combining those parts is fine. For scratchwork, I need to ensure everything is in natural language with explicit commas. I’ll say things like "x is six t" and verbalize expressions while making sure there are no mathematical symbols, replacing them with words like "is."**Vocalizing mathematical content**

I’m organizing how to verbalize the coordinates appropriately. For instance, I should say "open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis" and ensure to vocalize commas. The problem statement needs to be fully in spoken language, avoiding any mathematical symbols. 

I will specify the question type as "line_integral" and format the main answer to say "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six." The scratchwork will detail each step in natural language, using "the quantity" where necessary for clarity, and ensuring no symbols appear throughout the entire content.
