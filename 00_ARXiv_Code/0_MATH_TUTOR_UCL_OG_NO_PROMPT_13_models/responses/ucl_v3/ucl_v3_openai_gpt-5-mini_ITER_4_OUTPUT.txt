**Simplifying integrals**

I need to vocalize mathematical terms, like "inner product of," which isn’t really relevant here. I’m simplifying the integrand for the integral: (6t)^3 becomes 216t^3. This changes the integrand to 216t^3 times (4 - t)√46. Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives me 864/5√46. I can express the result as "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six." I could also approximate numerically but won’t expand the square root.**Calculating with precision**

I’m calculating 6.78233 multiplied by 172.8, which I can simplify by breaking it down. First, 172.8 times 6 gives me 1036.8, and then about 135.2 for the remaining part, totaling around 1172.0. I’ll double-check: multiplying gives me 1171.99, which is consistent! I must leave the answer in its exact form, ensuring the JSON syntax is valid for the output. I'll use a "tts_ready" format without symbols for clarity, like saying "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four divided by five times the square root of forty-six."**Structuring the JSON output**

I remember discussing the sub transforms earlier in linear algebra, but that’s not necessary here. I should include a problem number, setting it to "1." The template needs an extracted identifier, so I'll stick with that. I’ll focus on crafting a valid JSON output while ensuring it’s properly formatted with correct quotes and escaping. 

I'll finalize the content like this: the problem statement asks to evaluate the line integral, and the final answer will be clearly stated as requested.**Detailing the scratchwork steps**

I’m laying out the scratchwork steps for the line integral evaluation. First, I’ll parameterize the curve with r of t as the vector (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t ranging from zero to one. Next, I’ll compute r prime of t, which gives me the vector (6, -3, -1) and its norm as √46, so dS is √46 dt. Then, I’ll substitute into the integrand, where x cubed z times dS changes to (6t)^3 times (4 - t) times √46 dt. I’ll avoid using "end quantity" for clarity.**Processing the integral steps**

First, I’ll simplify the expression: six t to the power of three equals 216t^3, so the integrand becomes 216t^3 times (4 - t) times √46. Next, I integrate from zero to one, leading to 216√46 times the integral of (4t^3 - t^4) dt. For the scalar integral, the integral of 4t^3 from zero to one equals one, while the integral of t^4 gives one-fifth, so I find (1 - 1/5) equals four-fifths. Then, multiplying 216 by four-fifths gives 864/5. I need to ensure everything is in proper JSON format, using escape quotes where necessary.
