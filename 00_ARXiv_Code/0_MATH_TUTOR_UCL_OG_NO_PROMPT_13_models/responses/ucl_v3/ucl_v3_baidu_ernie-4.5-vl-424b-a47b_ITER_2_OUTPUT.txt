=== REASONING / THINKING ===

We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

 First, we parameterize the line segment.
 Let t be a parameter that goes from 0 to 1.
 At t=0: (x,y,z) = (0,6,4)
 At t=1: (x,y,z) = (6,3,3)

 The vector from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) is <6-0, 3-6, 3-4> = <6, -3, -1>.
 Therefore, the parametric equations are:
   x(t) = 0 + 6t
   y(t) = 6 - 3t
   z(t) = 4 - t

 The differential arc length ds is given by |r'(t)| dt.
 We compute r'(t) = <dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt> = <6, -3, -1>.
 The magnitude |r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36+9+1) = √46.

 Now, the integral becomes:
   ∫_C x³ z ds = ∫_{t=0}^{1} [ (x(t))³ * z(t) ] * |r'(t)| dt
                = ∫_{0}^{1} [ (6t)³ * (4 - t) ] * √46 dt
                = √46 ∫_{0}^{1} (216 t³) (4 - t) dt   [since 6³=216]
                = 216 √46 ∫_{0}^{1} (4t³ - t⁴) dt

 Now we integrate term by term:
   ∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - (1/5)t⁵] from 0 to 1? Let me compute:
   Actually: ∫4t³ dt = t⁴, and ∫ -t⁴ dt = - (1/5) t⁵.
   So the integral is [ t⁴ - (1/5) t⁵ ] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5.

 Alternatively, we can write:
   ∫_{0}^{1} (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [4*(t⁴/4) - (t⁵/5)]_{0}^{1} = [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_{0}^{1} = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

 Therefore, the integral is 216 √46 * (4/5).

 Simplifying: 216 * 4/5 = 864/5.

 So the answer is (864/5) √46.

 However, we can write it as a single fraction: (864 √46) / 5.

 We should check if we can simplify, but 864 and 5 are coprime? 864 is divisible by 2,3, etc. but 5 is prime so yes.

 Alternatively, we can factor 864: 864 = 2^5 * 3^3, so no common factors with 5.

 Therefore, the final answer is (864 √46) / 5.

 But note: we can also leave it as (216 * 4/5) √46 = 864/5 √46.

 Now, for the TTS format:

 We are to convert to natural spoken language.

 Steps:
   The line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length along the curve C.
   The curve C is the line segment from the point (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

   We'll express the parameterization:

   "Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1. Then, we have: 
    x equals 6 times t, 
    y equals 6 minus 3 times t, 
    z equals 4 minus t.

    The differential arc length ds is the magnitude of the derivative vector times dt, and that magnitude is square root of 46.

    The integral becomes: 
        the integral from t equals 0 to 1 of ( (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) ) times square root of 46 dt.

    Simplify the integrand: 
        (6t)^3 = 216 t cubed, so we have 216 t cubed times (4 minus t) which is 216 (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth).

    Then multiply by square root of 46: 216 square root of 46 times (4t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.

    Then integrate from 0 to 1: 
        216 square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of (4t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.

    The integral of 4t cubed is t to the fourth, and the integral of minus t to the fourth is minus (t to the fifth over 5).
        So: [t to the fourth minus (t to the fifth over 5)] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5.

    Therefore, the result is 216 times 4/5 times square root of 46 = 864/5 square root of 46.

    We can write 864 over 5, or as a mixed number but it's an improper fraction: 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, but we leave as fraction."

 However, for TTS we might say:

   "The value of the integral is 864 over 5 times the square root of 46."

 But note: in the template we are to put the answer in a specific JSON format.

 Since the problem is a calculation, we only have a main_answer and possibly scratchwork.

 But note: the problem says "Evaluate", so we are to compute a number.

 However, the answer is a scalar: (864/5)√46.

 But let me double-check the integral:

   ∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 - 0 = 4/5.

   Then 216 * √46 * 4/5 = (216*4/5) √46 = (864/5) √46.

 We'll present the answer as a fraction times square root.

 For the JSON output:

   problem_number: if given, but the problem doesn't have a number? We can leave as "1" or if not specified, we can skip? But the template requires "problem_number". 
   Since the image just says "Evaluate...", we can set problem_number to "1".

   problem_statement: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

   But note: we must convert to natural spoken language without mathematical symbols? However, the problem statement input has symbols? 
   The requirement says: "problem_statement field MUST contain ONLY natural spoken language with ZERO mathematical symbols remaining".

   So we convert the entire problem statement.

   We can write: 
        "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length along the curve C, 
         where C is the line segment from the point (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

   question_type: This is a free-response calculation, so we don't have multiple choice. The template doesn't specify a type for free-response? 
                But the problem is just an expression evaluation. We can set as "calculation".

   math_content_check: "yes"

   final_answers: 
        main_answer: 
            type: "scalar"
            values: [ "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six" ] 
            but note: we must use TTS representation. We break it down.

        Alternatively, we can write the expression in words.

        How to say: (864/5) √46?

        We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six"

        However, 864/5 is 864 over 5, so we can say "eight hundred sixty-four over five, multiplied by the square root of forty-six".

        But note the rule: for fractions we are to use: "numerator over denominator".

        Since it's a scalar value, we can also write it as a single expression.

        We'll do: 
            "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

        Alternatively, we can compute the numerical value? But the problem does not require a decimal. We leave exact.

   scratchwork_answer: We can include the steps as above.

   However, the scratchwork might be long. The optimization engine says if the response is over 2000 characters, we compress. But we are at the beginning.

   We'll write the scratchwork in TTS format as well, but note that the scratchwork is for calculation steps and we require TTS semantic format for the values.

   Since the scratchwork steps are many, we can break them into a list? But the template for scratchwork_answer has "values" as a list.

   We can do:

        scratchwork_answer: [
            "Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.",
            "Then x equals 6 times t, y equals 6 minus 3 times t, z equals 4 minus t.",
            "The magnitude of the derivative vector is square root of 46.",
            "The integral becomes: the integral from t equals 0 to 1 of ( (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) ) times square root of 46 dt.",
            "Simplify: (6t) cubed is 216 t cubed, so we have 216 t cubed times (4 minus t) which is 216 (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth).",
            "Multiply by square root of 46: 216 square root of 46 times (4t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.",
            "Integrate: 216 square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of (4t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.",
            "The antiderivative of 4t cubed is t to the fourth, of minus t to the fourth is minus one fifth t to the fifth.",
            "Evaluate: at t=1: 1 to the fourth minus one fifth times 1 to the fifth equals 1 minus 1/5 = 4/5, at t=0: 0. So the integral is 4/5.",
            "Therefore, the result is 216 times 4/5 times square root of 46 = 864/5 square root of 46."
        ]

   But note: the scratchwork must be in TTS format. We break into steps.

   However, the problem is that the scratchwork has mathematical symbols? We must convert to words.

   How to express "∫" in words? We can say "integral from t equals 0 to 1".

   We are to use explicit speech patterns.

   We'll do:

        Step 1: "Parameterize the line segment: set t from 0 to 1, then x equals 6 t, y equals 6 minus 3 t, z equals 4 minus t."
        Step 2: "Compute the derivative vector: dr by dt equals (6, -3, -1), and its magnitude is the square root of 6 squared plus (-3) squared plus (-1) squared, which is square root of 36 plus 9 plus 1, equals square root of 46."
        Step 3: "The line integral becomes: integral from t equals 0 to 1 of ( (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) ) times square root of 46 dt."
        Step 4: "Simplify the expression: (6t) cubed equals 216 t cubed. So we have 216 t cubed times (4 minus t), which is 216 times (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth)."
        Step 5: "Factor out constant: 216 square root of 46 times integral from 0 to 1 of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt."
        Step 6: "Integrate term by term: the integral of 4 t cubed is t to the fourth, and the integral of minus t to the fourth is minus one fifth t to the fifth."
        Step 7: "Evaluate from 0 to 1: at t equals 1: 1 to the fourth minus one fifth equals 1 minus one fifth equals four fifths; at t equals 0: 0."
        Step 8: "Multiply: 216 square root of 46 times four fifths equals the fraction 216 times 4 over 5 times square root of 46, which is eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six."

   We'll write each step as a string in the list.

   However, note the requirement: for lists, we must vocalize commas. But in the steps, we have lists of terms? Actually, the steps are long and not lists of numbers. 

   We are to use explicit comma vocalization only in lists (like coordinates, vectors, etc.). For the scratchwork steps, they are sentences. So we write naturally.

   But note: in step 4 we have "4 t cubed minus t to the fourth" - that is not a list? It's a polynomial expression. We say it as "4 t cubed minus t to the fourth".

   Similarly, in step 6: "minus one fifth t to the fifth" - that's a single term.

   We'll write the scratchwork as a list of sentences.

   But the template says: scratchwork_answer: { "values": [ ... ] } and each value is a string in TTS format.

   We must count the blanks? There are no blanks in this problem. So blank_count=0.

   Also, the question_type: we don't have a multiple choice, so we can set as "calculation". The template doesn't have a default for this? But in the switch case, we have cases for multiple choice, multiple selection, fill in blanks, and specific domains. This is a free-response calculation, so we use the default: minimal tracking.

   In the default: apply minimal tracking -> we just output the answer and optional scratchwork? and we use efficiency principle: meaning we don't add unnecessary steps? But we have provided the essential steps.

   Now, to the JSON:

   We are to output:

        {
          "problem_number": "1",
          "problem_statement": "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length along the curve C, where C is the line segment from the point (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).",
          "question_type": "calculation",   # or perhaps "free_response"? but the template doesn't specify. Let me see the switch cases: they are for selection and fill in blanks. We can set as "calculation".

          "final_answers": {
            "main_answer": {
                "type": "scalar",
                "values": [ "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six" ],
                "answer_format": "tts_ready"
            },
            "scratchwork_answer": {
                "values": [
                    "Parameterize the line segment: set t from 0 to 1. Then x equals 6 t, y equals 6 minus 3 t, z equals 4 minus t.",
                    "Compute the derivative vector with respect to t: (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of this vector is the square root of (6 squared plus (-3) squared plus (-1) squared) equals square root of (36 plus 9 plus 1) equals square root of 46.",
                    "The line integral becomes: the integral from t equals 0 to 1 of ( (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) ) times square root of 46 with respect to t.",
                    "Simplify: (6t) cubed equals 216 t cubed. Therefore, the expression inside the integral becomes 216 t cubed times (4 minus t) which is 216 times (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth).",
                    "Factor out the constant: 216 square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) with respect to t.",
                    "Integrate term by term: the integral of 4 t cubed is t to the fourth. The integral of minus t to the fourth is minus one fifth t to the fifth. So the antiderivative is t to the fourth minus (one fifth t to the fifth).",
                    "Evaluate the antiderivative from 0 to 1: at t equals 1, we have 1 to the fourth minus one fifth equals 1 minus 0.2 equals 0.8 which is four fifths. At t equals 0, we get 0. So the definite integral is four fifths.",
                    "Multiply: 216 square root of 46 times four fifths equals (216 * 4 / 5) square root of 46 which is eight hundred sixty-four fifths square root of forty-six."
                ],
                "answer_format": "tts_ready"
            }
          }
        }

   However, note: the main_answer value is a bit long. We can also write it as:

        "The result is the fraction eight hundred sixty-four fifths multiplied by the square root of forty-six."

   But the requirement is to have the answer in TTS, so we use the expanded form.

   We must ensure no mathematical symbols appear. We have written in words.

   Now, note the requirement: "ZERO mathematical symbols remaining". We have replaced all with words.

   Also, for the norm and inner product? We didn't have any in the calculation? We only had a vector magnitude which we expressed in words.

   We are safe.

   But wait: in step 7 we said "0.8" and "0.2". We must avoid decimals? We can write:

        "0.8" -> "four fifths", "0.2" -> "one fifth".

   So we修订 step 7:

        "At t equals 1, we have 1 to the fourth minus one fifth equals 1 minus one fifth equals four fifths. At t equals 0, we get 0. So the definite integral is four fifths."

   We'll change step 7 accordingly.

   Also, step 8: "216 * 4 / 5" -> we can say "two hundred sixteen multiplied by four, then divided by five", but we did that? Actually, we did it as "216 * 4 / 5" in words: "216 times 4 over 5". We wrote as "eight hundred sixty-four fifths" meaning 864/5.

   We are good.

   Let me write the step 8 again to avoid the decimal:

        "Multiply: 216 square root of 46 times four fifths equals ... which is 864 over 5 times square root of 46, which we read as 'eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six'."

   But wait, 216 * 4 = 864, so 864/5, yes.

   Now, note: the factor 216 comes from 6 cubed, but we already broke it down.

   We are ready.

   However, note: the problem says the integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, and we computed it as 864√46/5.

   We must ensure that the scratchwork is in TTS format and each string is a natural spoken sentence.

   We'll write the scratchwork as described.

   But note: the step 2 has "6 squared plus (-3) squared plus (-1) squared": we can say "negative three" and "negative one", but when squaring it becomes positive. Alternatively, we can say:

        "The magnitude of the vector (6, -3, -1) is the square root of (6 squared plus (negative 3) squared plus (negative 1) squared)."

   But to avoid confusion, we can say:

        "The magnitude is the square root of (6 times 6 plus 3 times 3 plus 1 times 1) but note that the y-component is negative, but when squared it becomes positive, so that's 36 plus 9 plus 1 equals 46."

   However, the rule for negative numbers: we say "negative three", but when we square, we don't say "negative three squared" we say "negative three to the power two", but actually we can say: "the square of negative three is nine".

   We can break it down:

        "The x-component is 6, squared is 36. The y-component is negative 3, squared is 9. The z-component is negative 1, squared is 1. So the sum is 36 plus 9 plus 1 equals 46."

   So step 2 revised:

        "Compute the derivative vector with respect to t: (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of this vector is the square root of: 6 squared is 36, negative 3 squared is 9, negative 1 squared is 1, so 36 plus 9 plus 1 equals 46. Therefore, the magnitude is square root of 46."

   We'll use that.

   Final scratchwork:

        [
          "Parameterize the line segment: set t from 0 to 1. Then x equals 6 t, y equals 6 minus 3 t, z equals 4 minus t.",
          "Compute the derivative vector with respect to t: (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of this vector is the square root of: 6 squared is 36, negative 3 squared is 9, negative 1 squared is 1, so 36 plus 9 plus 1 equals 46. Therefore, the magnitude is square root of 46.",
          "The line integral becomes: the integral from t equals 0 to 1 of ( (6t) cubed times (4 minus t) ) times square root of 46 with respect to t.",
          "Simplify: (6t) cubed equals 216 t cubed. Therefore, the expression inside the integral becomes 216 t cubed times (4 minus t) which is 216 times (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth).",
          "Factor out the constant: 216 square root of 46 times the integral from 0 to 1 of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) with respect to t.",
          "Integrate term by term: the integral of 4 t cubed is t to the fourth. The integral of minus t to the fourth is minus one fifth t to the fifth. So the antiderivative is t to the fourth minus (one fifth t to the fifth).",
          "Evaluate the antiderivative from 0 to 1: at t equals 1, we have 1 to the fourth minus one fifth equals 1 minus one fifth equals four fifths. At t equals 0, we get 0. So the definite integral is four fifths.",
          "Multiply: 216 square root of 46 times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six, which we read as 'eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six'."
        ]

   For the main_answer value, we use the last part: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six".

   But note: we must not use the fraction bar symbol? We did use "over" in the scratchwork, but in the main_answer we are using a string. We can say:

        We are using: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths" meaning 864/5.

   This is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we can say "eight hundred sixty-four over five", but the transformation rule says for fractions: "numerator over denominator". So "eight hundred sixty-four over five" is clear.

   We'll use "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six".

   But note: in the main_answer, we can also write it without repeating: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five" is not the same? No, because multiplication is commutative. However, to be faithful to the expression (864/5)√46, we should say:

        "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

   But we can also say: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, then divided by five". However, the rule for fractions: we are to say numerator over denominator. Here, the fraction is only for the scalar part.

   Since 864/5 is a scalar factor and then multiplied by √46, we can break:

        "eight hundred sixty-four over five" and then "times the square root of forty-six"

   So the string is: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six"

   This is standard.

   Now, we write the JSON.

   However, note: the problem says to output the JSON. We must be cautious with the data types.

   We are to output a JSON string. We'll write it as a string.

   But since this is a text response, we write the JSON as a code block.

   We'll now write the JSON.

**Explanation:**
- **Parameterization:** The line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) is parameterized with \( t \in [0,1] \): \( x = 6t \), \( y = 6 - 3t \), \( z = 4 - t \).
- **Arc Length Element:** The derivative vector \( \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle \) has magnitude \( \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{46} \), so \( ds = \sqrt{46}  dt \).
- **Integral Setup:** Substituting \( x^3 z \), the integral becomes \( \int_0^1 (6t)^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216t^3 (4 - t)  dt \).
- **Simplification:** Expand to \( 216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt \).
- **Integration:** Compute \( \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \).
- **Final Result:** Multiply by constants: \( 216 \times \frac{4}{5} \times \sqrt{46} = \frac{864}{5}\sqrt{46} \), read as "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six." The scratchwork details each step in TTS-compatible language.
