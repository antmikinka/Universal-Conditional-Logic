=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). First, I need to parameterize the curve C.

To parameterize a line segment between two points, I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The general formula for a line segment from point A to point B is r(t) = A + t(B - A). Let me write down the coordinates.

Point A is (0, 6, 4) and point B is (6, 3, 3). So the vector from A to B is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Therefore, the parameterization should be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

Where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds. For a line integral, ds is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, multiplied by dt. So first, compute dr/dt.

dr/dt = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x(t) and z(t) into the integrand x³ z. So x³ z = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216 (4t³ - t⁴).

The integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [216 (4t³ - t⁴)] * sqrt(46) dt.

Factor out the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Compute the integral of 4t³ - t⁴. The antiderivative is 4*(t⁴/4) - t⁵/5 = t⁴ - t⁵/5.

Evaluate from 0 to 1: (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5.

So the integral is 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the arithmetic. 216 * 4 = 864, yes. So 864/5 sqrt(46). That should be the answer.

Let me double-check the parameterization. When t=0, (x,y,z)=(0,6,4), correct. When t=1, (6,3,3), correct. The derivative components are correct, magnitude sqrt(46). The integrand substitution seems right. The integral calculation: ∫(4t³ - t⁴) from 0 to1 is [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Multiply by 216*sqrt(46): 216*(4/5) = 864/5. So yes, 864/5 times sqrt(46).

So the final answer is (864√46)/5.
