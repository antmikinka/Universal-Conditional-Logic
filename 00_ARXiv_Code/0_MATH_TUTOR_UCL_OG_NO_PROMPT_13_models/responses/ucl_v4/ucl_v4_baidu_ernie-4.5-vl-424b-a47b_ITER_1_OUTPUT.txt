We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 Steps:
 1. Parametrize the line segment.
 2. Compute the derivatives of the parametrization with respect to the parameter.
 3. Compute the magnitude of the derivative (speed) to get ds.
 4. Express x, z, and ds in terms of the parameter.
 5. Integrate over the parameter.

 Step 1: Parametrize the line segment.
 Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
   x(t) = (1-t)*0 + t*6 = 6t
   y(t) = (1-t)*6 + t*3 = 6 - 3t
   z(t) = (1-t)*4 + t*3 = 4 - t

 Step 2: Compute derivatives:
   dx/dt = 6
   dy/dt = -3
   dz/dt = -1

 Step 3: Compute the speed (magnitude of the derivative vector):
   |r'(t)| = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) 
            = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) 
            = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) 
            = sqrt(46)

 So, ds = |r'(t)| dt = sqrt(46) dt.

 Step 4: The integral becomes:
   ∫_C x^3 z ds = ∫_{t=0}^{1} [ (6t)^3 * (4 - t) ] * sqrt(46) dt

 Step 5: Simplify and integrate:
   = sqrt(46) * ∫_0^1 [ 216 t^3 * (4 - t) ] dt
   = 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt

 Compute the integral:
   ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [ t^4 - (t^5)/5 ] from 0 to 1
                     = [1 - 1/5] - 0 
                     = 4/5

 So, the integral = 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5)

 But note: 216 * 4/5 = 864/5 = 172.8

 Therefore, the integral = 172.8 * sqrt(46)

 However, we should leave in exact form.

 Alternatively, we can write:
   = (216 * 4 / 5) * sqrt(46)
   = (864 / 5) * sqrt(46)

 We can also compute the numerical value, but the problem doesn't specify. However, for TTS we need natural spoken language.

 However, note the requirement: we must output in a JSON format with TTS-ready strings.

 But the problem asks for the final answer. We have the exact form: (864/5) * sqrt(46) or we can simplify to (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 But note: 864/5 is 172.8, so we can write as (172.8) * sqrt(46) but that is not exact. So better to write as fraction.

 Alternatively, we can write: 
   ∫ = (864/5) * √46

 However, we can also factor: 864 and 5 have no common factors.

 But let's check if we can simplify sqrt(46)? 46=2*23, so no.

 Therefore, the exact answer is (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 Alternatively, we can write as a single fraction: (864√46)/5.

 Now, for TTS conversion:

 We need to express this in natural spoken language.

 According to the rules:
   fraction: "{{numerator}} over {{denominator}}"
   root: "square root of {{radicand}}"

 So, the answer: 
   (864√46) / 5  -> "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

 However, note that the entire expression is a fraction: numerator is 864√46, denominator is 5.

 Alternatively, we can break it: "eight hundred sixty-four over five, multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 But the instruction says to vocalize as a single fraction? The rule for fractions: "numerator over denominator".

 However, the expression is a product? We have two parts: 864/5 and √46. But the entire expression is (864√46)/5, which is a product of two terms in the numerator? Actually, it's a fraction with numerator 864√46 and denominator 5.

 How to handle mixed operations? We should follow the order.

 Alternatively, we can write: "the square root of forty-six multiplied by eight hundred sixty-four over five"

 But the rule for multiplication is not explicitly given, but we can say "times". However, the rule says to preserve accuracy, so we need to make sure it's clear.

 Another way: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, all over five"

 Let's choose: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six" OR "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six, divided by five".

 But note: the order of operations: multiplication and division have the same precedence and are left associative. So (864√46)/5 is the same as 864/5 * √46. But 864/5 is 172.8, and 172.8 * √46. So we can also say "one hundred seventy-two point eight times the square root of forty-six". However, 172.8 is exact? But 864/5 is 172.8, which is exact as a decimal? Actually, 864/5 is 172.8 exactly. But the square root of 46 is irrational. So we can use that.

 However, the problem might expect an exact form. The instruction says to preserve mathematical accuracy.

 Therefore, I think the fractional form with the square root is better.

 So, we choose: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

 But note: the rule says to vocalize the fraction: numerator and denominator. We have a product in the numerator? We can consider the entire expression as a fraction with numerator being 864√46 and denominator 5.

 How to vocalize 864√46? It's 864 times the square root of 46.

 So: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

 Alternatively, if we break the fraction: "the fraction with numerator eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six and denominator five"

 But that is wordy.

 Another common way: "eight hundred sixty-four root forty-six over five" is not clear.

 We'll go with: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

 However, note the requirement: Express in natural spoken language. So we can use:

   "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

 But to be precise, we can say: "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six all over five"

 Since therules emphasize explicit vocalization of mathematical structures, we can use:

   "open parenthesis eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six close parenthesis over five"

 But without parenthesis? We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, then divided by five"

 However, the instruction for fractions: "numerator over denominator", so we can also say:

   numerator: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six"
   denominator: "five"

 So: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

 But note: the entire expression is one fraction? Actually, it's a fraction. So we can use:

   "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

 However, the rule doesn't specify how to handle multiple terms in numerator. We are following the spirit: the numerator is a product.

 Alternatively, we can avoid potential confusion by using:

   "eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six, all divided by five"

 But I think "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five" is acceptable.

 However, let's consider the scratchwork: we are to provide the calculation steps in TTS-ready form as well.

 Calculation steps:

 We had:
   Integral = sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt
            = sqrt(46) * 216 * [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1
            = sqrt(46) * 216 * (1 - 1/5)
            = sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5)
            = sqrt(46) * (864/5)
            = 864 * sqrt(46) / 5

 So, we can write the steps as:

   Step 1: sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt
   Step 2: Compute the integral: ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.
   Step 3: So, sqrt(46) * 216 * 4/5 = sqrt(46) * (864/5) = 864 * sqrt(46) / 5.

 Now, converting each step to natural spoken language:

   Step 1: "square root of forty-six times two hundred sixteen times the definite integral from zero to one of the quantity four t cubed minus t to the fourth power with respect to t"

   Step 2: "Compute the definite integral: first, the antiderivative of four t cubed is t to the fourth, and the antiderivative of minus t to the fourth is minus t to the fifth over five. Evaluated from zero to one: at one, one to the fourth minus one to the fifth over five equals one minus one fifth equals four fifths."

   Step 3: "Then, square root of forty-six times two hundred sixteen times four fifths. Two hundred sixteen times four is eight hundred sixty-four. So we have square root of forty-six times eight hundred sixty-four over five."

 However, note that 216*4=864, and then we put over five: so "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

 Alternatively, we can write the entire calculation in one step? But the requirement says to provide scratchwork.

 We'll break it into steps as above.

 But note: the scratchwork is for the JSON output under "scratchwork_answer". We need to list the steps.

 We can have:

   Step 1: Parametrize the curve: from point (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) with t from 0 to 1.
   Step 2: Set x(t)=6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t.
   Step 3: The derivatives: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1.
   Step 4: Speed: |dr/dt| = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.
   Step 5: The integrand becomes: x(t)^3 * z(t) * ds = (6t)^3 * (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt = 216 t^3 (4-t) sqrt(46) dt.
   Step 6: Integrate with respect to t: 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt.
   Step 7: Compute the integral ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - t^5/5]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.
   Step 8: Multiply: 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = 864 * sqrt(46) / 5.

 However, we are to provide TTS-ready strings. So we convert each step.

 Alternatively, we can combine some steps? But the requirement is to have steps.

 We'll break into 8 steps? That might be too detailed. We can combine.

 But for clarity, we'll do:

   Step 1: Parametrize the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) by t from 0 to 1: x=6t, y=6-3t, z=4-t.
   Step 2: Compute the derivatives: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1.
   Step 3: The magnitude of the derivative vector is sqrt(6^2+(-3)^2+(-1)^2)=sqrt(46). Thus, ds=sqrt(46) dt.
   Step 4: The integral becomes ∫ from 0 to 1 of (6t)^3 * (4-t) * sqrt(46) dt = ∫ from 0 to 1 of 216 t^3 (4-t) sqrt(46) dt.
   Step 5: Factor out sqrt(46) and 216: 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫ from 0 to 1 of (4t^3 - t^4) dt.
   Step 6: Compute the integral: [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.
   Step 7: Then, 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = 864 * sqrt(46) / 5.

 Now, convert each step to natural language.

 We have to be careful with mathematical expressions.

 Step 1: 
   "Parametrize the line segment from the point open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis to the point open parenthesis six comma three comma three close parenthesis by the parameter t from zero to one: x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t."

 Step 2:
   "Compute the derivatives: the derivative of x with respect to t is six, the derivative of y with respect to t is negative three, and the derivative of z with respect to t is negative one."

 Step 3:
   "The magnitude of the derivative vector is the square root of six squared plus negative three squared plus negative one squared, which equals square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one, that is square root of forty-six. Thus, d s equals square root of forty-six d t."

 Step 4:
   "The line integral becomes the definite integral from zero to one of the quantity open parenthesis six t close parenthesis cubed times the quantity open parenthesis four minus t close parenthesis times square root of forty-six d t. Simplifying the integrand: open parenthesis six t close parenthesis cubed is two hundred sixteen t cubed, so the integrand becomes two hundred sixteen t cubed times open parenthesis four minus t close parenthesis times square root of forty-six d t."

 Step 5:
   "Factor out the constants: two hundred sixteen and square root of forty-six, giving two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times the definite integral from zero to one of the quantity four t cubed minus t to the fourth power d t."

 Step 6:
   "Compute the definite integral: the antiderivative of four t cubed is t to the fourth, and the antiderivative of negative t to the fourth is negative t to the fifth over five. Evaluating from zero to one: at one, one to the fourth minus one to the fifth over five equals one minus one fifth equals four fifths. At zero, both terms are zero. So the integral equals four fifths."

 Step 7:
   "Then, multiply: two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times four fifths. First, two hundred sixteen times four is eight hundred sixty-four. Then, eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six. Alternatively, the final result is eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six over five."

 But note: in step 7, we have 216 * 4 = 864, then that over 5? Actually, 216 * (4/5) = (216*4)/5 = 864/5, then multiplied by sqrt(46): so 864/5 * sqrt(46). So we can say: "The result is eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six."

 However, to be precise, we say: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five."

 But note: the order of operations? We can also say: "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four over five, multiplied by the square root of forty-six."

 Now, for the JSON output:

   We have:
      problem_number: We don't have a problem number? The image doesn't show one. We can set to "1" or leave empty? The template has "problem_number". Since the problem statement doesn't specify, we can set as "unknown" or omit? But the template expects a string. We can set as "1" if it's the first problem? Or we can leave as empty string? But the requirement is to populate. Alternatively, we can extract: the problem is given without a number. So we can set problem_number as "N/A".

   problem_statement: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x cubed z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

   But we must convert the entire problem statement to natural spoken language? The requirement: "problem_statement" field MUST contain ONLY natural spoken language with ZERO mathematical symbols.

   So we convert the problem statement:

        Original: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, Where: C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

        Converted: "Evaluate the line integral: integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s, where C is the line segment from open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis to open parenthesis six comma three comma three close parenthesis."

   However, note the rule: vocalize comma explicitly. So we write "comma" for the point.

   We also note that the integral symbol becomes "integral" and d s becomes "d s". But in the rule, the integral is a function? We transform the function notation: "integral of ...".

   Actually, the rule for function notation: "{{function_name}} of {{parameters}}". Here, the integral is an operator. So:

        "the integral over curve C of the expression x cubed times z with respect to s"

   But note: the integral is a line integral, so we specify "over curve C". The function being integrated is x^3 z, and with respect to s (arc length).

   Alternatively: "the line integral over curve C of the function x cubed times z with respect to arc length s"

   Then the entire problem statement:

        "Evaluate the line integral: the line integral over curve C of the function x cubed times z with respect to arc length s, where curve C is the line segment from the point open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis to the point open parenthesis six comma three comma three close parenthesis."

   But that is redundant? We can say:

        "Evaluate the line integral over curve C, where curve C is the line segment from the point open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis to the point open parenthesis six comma three comma three close parenthesis, of the function x cubed times z with respect to arc length s."

   Question type: we are to detect. The problem is to compute a definite integral? But specifically a line integral. The question type can be "line_integral" or "integration". However, the condition for question_type: if it's fill_in_blanks and multiple blanks, use numbered blank. But this is not fill-in-blanks. So we can set question_type as "line_integral" or "integral_calculation".

   But the instruction: "Detect question_type from problem_structure". We can set:

        question_type: "line_integral"

   Math_content_check: we set to "yes".

   Final answers:
        main_answer: 
            type: "expression" or "exact_value"? We can set type as "expression" since it's an exact expression.
            values: ["eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"] OR as a string of the expression? But the requirement is TTS-ready. So we have the string as above.

        scratchwork_answer: an array of TTS-ready strings for each step.

   We have 7 steps? So we write an array of 7 strings.

   However, note that the JSON template:

        "final_answers": {
            "main_answer": {
                "type": "...",
                "values": [ ... ],   # array of one string? or multiple? The problem requires one answer? So one string.
                "answer_format": "tts_ready"
            },
            "scratchwork_answer": {
                "values": [ ... ],   # array of multiple strings for steps.
                "answer_format": "tts_ready"
            }
        }

   So for main_answer: "values" is an array with one element: the final answer string.

   For scratchwork_answer: "values" is an array of step strings.

   Now, let's write the JSON.

   Note: We must ensure no mathematical symbols in the JSON strings.

   We'll write the entire JSON.

   IMPORTANT: The problem does not specify to approximate, so we leave in exact form.

   Let's code the JSON accordingly.
