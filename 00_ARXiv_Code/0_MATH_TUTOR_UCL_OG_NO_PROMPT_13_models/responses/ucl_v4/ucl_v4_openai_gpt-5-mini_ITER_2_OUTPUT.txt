**Transforming math to speech**

I need to address a multiplication problem: "864 over 5 times the square root of 46." It’s important to say "times" clearly. I’ll convert the entire math expression into speech, placing emphasis on 'comma' for vectors and lists. Also, the Gram-Schmidt process isn’t needed here. I have to validate JSON for accuracy with fields like problem number and a descriptive statement, removing math symbols and turning them into words for clarity.**Clarifying line integral formatting**

I'm refining my approach for a line integral question. I've confirmed math content is there and that the answer type is set to an exact value. I need to decide how to represent values—should I use digits or words? Spoken natural language works best like "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six." I’ll ensure the answer is TTS ready and break down steps into vocalized segments, including clear notations like "open bracket" and "close bracket" for clarity.**Computing derivatives and integrands**

First, I need to compute the derivative of r with respect to t, which is given as a vector: "open bracket six, negative three, negative one close bracket.” The norm of this derivative should equal the square root of forty-six. I must remember that negative numbers should be referred to as "negative absolute_value," so "negative three" and "negative one" are fine. Next, I’ll substitute values for x and z, leading to the integrand expression: "six t to the power of three times four minus t," which simplifies to "two hundred sixteen t to the power of three times four minus t." I’ve got to ensure parentheses regarding the exponent are clear too!**Clarifying expressions and integrals**

I’ve decided to clarify my expressions. So, I’ll say "x equals six t and z equals four minus t," leading to: "x to the power of three times z equals (six t) to the power of three times (four minus t)," simplifying to "two hundred sixteen t to the power of three times (four minus t)." Now, the integral becomes the square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of "two hundred sixteen t to the power of three times (four minus t) d t." When I integrate, I find \(864 t^3 - 216 t^4\); evaluating gives consistent results.**Preparing JSON output**

I need to express my results in fraction form, describing it as "square root of forty-six times two hundred sixteen times (one minus one-fifth)," which simplifies to "square root of forty-six times eight hundred sixty-four over five." The numbers should be formatted as "eight hundred sixty-four over five" and "square root of forty-six." Next, I have to construct a JSON structure, making sure to escape quotes, and include all steps in a scratchwork array. I must keep the problem statement clear of symbols, vocalizing parentheses as needed, like "parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis." Let’s ensure everything is validated correctly!
