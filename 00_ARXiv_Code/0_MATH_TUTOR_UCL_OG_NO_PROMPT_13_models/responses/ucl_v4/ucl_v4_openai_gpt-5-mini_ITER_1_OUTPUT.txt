**Processing integral calculation**

I’m working on an integral calculation. The integral evaluates to 216 sqrt(46) multiplied by a simplified expression. I simplify it to (864/5) sqrt(46) by breaking down the components. Now, for the final answer presentation, I need to look into converting mathematical terms into words, like “to the power of” for exponents and “numerator over denominator” for fractions. Lastly, I’ll format the final answer as an array in the required JSON semantic format for clarity.**Crafting JSON content**

I'm determining how to structure my JSON output. The main answer type should be "exact_value," and I'll include the calculation steps formatted for text-to-speech in a numbered list. There's a rule about fill-in-the-blanks formatting, but it's not relevant here. I need to ensure the JSON is valid and free of mathematical symbols in the problem statement. 

For numbers, “sqrt(46)” will be written as "square root of forty six" and “864/5” as "eight hundred sixty four over five." Finally, I must vocalize "comma" in the coordinates. I'll prepare the JSON fields accordingly!**Structuring problem details**

I'm setting up the JSON fields for a line integral. For "problem_statement," I’ll use: "Evaluate the line integral over curve C of x to the power of three times z d s where C is the line segment from zero comma six comma four to six comma three comma three." I’ve got to avoid any mathematical symbols and I’ll use "times" for multiplication, since that seems acceptable.

The "question_type" will be "line_integral," and I’ll check the math content. My "final_answers" will specify the main answer type as "exact_value," and I'll surround the answer with clear, TTS-ready text, like "eight hundred sixty four over five times square root of forty six." Consistency is key with word formats, so I’ll ensure everything matches up!**Formatting answer steps**

I'm setting up the answer format to be TTS-ready. In "scratchwork_answer.values," I’ll outline the steps in full speech. For instance, "1) Parameterize r of t equals open bracket zero plus six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t close bracket," but I need to convert subtraction. Instead of using the minus symbol, I'll say, "six minus three t." 

That feels okay since it’s in words. I’ll also follow the exponent transform, saying "six t to the power of three" for (6t)^3, keeping it consistent with previous formats like "x to the power of three."**Writing integration steps**

I'm outlining the steps for the integral calculation. First, I'll parameterize the line as "r of t equals open bracket six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t close bracket" with t from zero to one. I'll compute the derivative and its norm, ensuring I use "square root of forty six" for clarity. 

Next, I'll substitute into the integrand, expressing it clearly. With simplifications like "six t to the power of three" equal to "two hundred sixteen t to the power of three," I'm crafting everything in natural language without symbols. Lastly, I’ll assemble this into a JSON format while adhering to the guidelines!
