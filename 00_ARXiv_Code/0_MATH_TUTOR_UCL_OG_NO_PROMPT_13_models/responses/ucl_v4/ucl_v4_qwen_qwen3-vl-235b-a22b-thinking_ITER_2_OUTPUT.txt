=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to evaluate the line integral of x³z ds over the curve C, which is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I need to remember how to compute a line integral of a scalar field. The general formula is ∫_C f(x,y,z) ds = ∫_a^b f(r(t)) ||r'(t)|| dt, where r(t) is the parametrization of the curve.

So, first step is to parametrize the line segment. The line segment from point A (0,6,4) to point B (6,3,3) can be parametrized using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The parametric equations would be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t (since it goes from 6 to 3, so -3t)

z(t) = 4 - t (from 4 to 3, so -t)

Wait, let me check that. The direction vector from A to B is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parametrization should be r(t) = A + t*(direction vector), where t ∈ [0,1].

So:

x(t) = 0 + 6t

y(t) = 6 + (-3)t = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 + (-1)t = 4 - t

Yes, that's correct.

Next, compute the derivative r'(t):

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

Then, the magnitude ||r'(t)|| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = ||r'(t)|| dt = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integrand is x³ z. Substitute x and z from the parametrization:

x(t) = 6t, so x³ = (6t)^3 = 216 t³

z(t) = 4 - t

So the integrand becomes 216 t³ (4 - t) * sqrt(46)

Therefore, the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of 216 t³ (4 - t) sqrt(46) dt.

Let's factor out the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ t³(4 - t) dt

Compute the integral inside:

∫ t³(4 - t) dt = ∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - (t⁵)/5] from 0 to 1

At t=1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

At t=0: 0 - 0 = 0

So the integral is 4/5.

Multiply by the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = (864/5) sqrt(46)

Wait, let me check the arithmetic. 216 * 4 = 864, yes. So 864/5 is 172.8, but we can leave it as a fraction.

So the final answer should be (864/5)√46.

Now, let's verify the steps to make sure.

Parametrization correct? Yes, direction vector (6, -3, -1), so r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4 - t).

r'(t) is (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36 + 9 +1)=sqrt(46). Correct.

Integrand x³ z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Correct.

Integral of 216 t³ (4 - t) sqrt(46) dt from 0 to1.

Integrate 4t³ - t⁴: integral is t^4 - t^5/5, evaluated from 0 to1 gives 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

Multiply 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = (864/5) sqrt(46). Yes.

So the main answer is 864/5 times the square root of 46.

Now, converting to TTS format as per the rules.

The problem statement needs to be in natural spoken language. The original problem says "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

Converted to TTS: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed z d s where C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

For the main answer: (864/5)√46. Using the transformation rules:

- Fraction: 864 over 5

- Square root: square root of 46

So it becomes "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

Wait, but 864/5 is a fraction, so "eight hundred sixty-four over five" multiplied by "square root of forty-six".

In TTS, numbers like 864 would be said as "eight hundred sixty-four", but sometimes "eight hundred and sixty-four", but the rules don't specify "and", so maybe just "eight hundred sixty-four".

Similarly, 46 is "forty-six".

So the main answer value would be "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

For the scratchwork, the steps need to be converted into TTS. Let's outline the steps:

1. Parametrize the curve C as r of t equals open bracket six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t close bracket for t from zero to one.

2. Compute the derivative r prime of t equals open bracket six comma negative three comma negative one close bracket.

3. Find the magnitude of r prime of t which is square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one equals square root of forty-six.

4. Substitute x equals six t and z equals four minus t into the integrand x cubed z to get two hundred sixteen t cubed times open bracket four minus t close bracket.

5. Multiply by the magnitude to get two hundred sixteen square root of forty-six times open bracket four t cubed minus t to the fourth close bracket.

6. Integrate from t equals zero to one: the integral of four t cubed minus t to the fourth is t to the fourth minus t to the fifth over five evaluated from zero to one equals four fifths.

7. Multiply constants: two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six.

Now, need to make sure all numbers are converted properly. For example, 216 is "two hundred sixteen", 46 is "forty-six", etc.

Also, in coordinates, use "comma" explicitly, like "open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket".

The problem statement in TTS should be all natural language.

Now, check the conditions. The problem contains "line integral", so the multiple_integrals_notation condition is activated. The transformation rules for line integrals would apply, so "line integral over curve C" but in the problem statement, it's "the line integral", so the TTS should say "line integral".

Also, the problem content has coordinates, so "open bracket ... close bracket" with commas.

The JSON output needs to have the problem statement in TTS, question type (probably "line_integral_calculation"), math_content_check "yes", main answer as the TTS string, and scratchwork steps as an array of TTS strings.

Let me structure the JSON.

Problem number: Not specified, maybe null or "1", but the input doesn't have a number. The problem says "problem_number" should be extracted. Since the input doesn't have a number, maybe it's empty. But the example input doesn't have a number, so perhaps set to null or empty string. Wait, the user's example problem doesn't have a number, so maybe problem_number is empty.

Question type: "line_integral_calculation" as per the content.

Math_content_check: "yes" since it's a math problem.

Main answer: the TTS of (864/5)√46.

Scratchwork_answer: array of TTS steps.

Let me write out the TTS for the problem statement:

"Evaluate the line integral of x cubed z d s where C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

For the main answer:

"eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

Scratchwork steps:

1. "Parametrize the curve C as r of t equals open bracket six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t close bracket for t from zero to one."

2. "Compute the derivative r prime of t equals open bracket six comma negative three comma negative one close bracket."

3. "Find the magnitude of r prime of t which is square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one equals square root of forty-six."

4. "Substitute x equals six t and z equals four minus t into the integrand x cubed z to get two hundred sixteen t cubed times open bracket four minus t close bracket."

5. "Multiply by the magnitude to get two hundred sixteen square root of forty-six times open bracket four t cubed minus t to the fourth close bracket."

6. "Integrate from t equals zero to one: the integral of four t cubed minus t to the fourth is t to the fourth minus t to the fifth over five evaluated from zero to one equals four fifths."

7. "Multiply constants: two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six."

Check if all numbers are correctly converted. For example, 216 is "two hundred sixteen", 46 is "forty-six", etc.

Also, in the scratchwork, "negative three" for -3, which follows the negative number transformation rule.

The integral steps: "t to the fourth minus t to the fifth over five" etc.

Yes, that seems correct.

Now, the JSON structure should have:

problem_number: probably empty, but the template says extracted_identifier. Since the input doesn't specify a problem number, maybe it's empty string or null. Let's assume it's "1" as a default, but the problem doesn't have a number. Wait, the user's input says "problem_number" should be extracted. Since there's no number, perhaps it's an empty string. But the example might expect it to be null. However, the problem statement given doesn't have a number, so problem_number: "".

Question_type: "line_integral_calculation" or maybe "computation". But the conditions might set it to "line_integral_calculation" based on the problem content.

The problem content contains "line integral", so the question type is determined as line integral calculation.

The math_content_check is "yes".

Final answers: main_answer type might be "result", and scratchwork as the steps.

So putting it all together.
