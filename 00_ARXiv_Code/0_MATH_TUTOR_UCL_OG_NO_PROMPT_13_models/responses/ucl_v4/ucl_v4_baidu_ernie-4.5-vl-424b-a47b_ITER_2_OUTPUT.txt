We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 We need to convert this to TTS-compatible spoken language and output in the specified JSON format.

 Steps:
 1. Parameterize the line segment.
 2. Express the integral in terms of the parameter.
 3. Convert mathematical expressions to natural spoken language.

 Parameterization:
 Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.
 The line segment can be written as:
   x = 0 + (6-0)t = 6t
   y = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t
   z = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

 Then, ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt
   dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1
   ds = sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) dt = sqrt(36+9+1) dt = sqrt(46) dt

 The integrand: x³ z = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴

 Therefore, the integral becomes:
   ∫_{t=0}^{1} (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt

 We can factor out sqrt(46):
   sqrt(46) * ∫_{0}^{1} (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt

 Compute the integral:
   ∫ (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt = 864*(t^4/4) - 216*(t^5/5) = 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5
   Evaluate from 0 to 1: 
        [216*(1)^4 - (216/5)*(1)^5] - 0 = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5 = 172.8

 Then multiply by sqrt(46): 172.8 * sqrt(46)

 However, note that we are to output in TTS format and also provide the step-by-step scratchwork.

 But note the problem says "Evaluate", so we are to compute the number.

 However, the output specification requires:
   - The problem statement in natural spoken language (without symbols).
   - The final answer in TTS-ready format.
   - The scratchwork in TTS-ready format.

 We are to output in JSON.

 Steps for JSON:

   problem_number: We can assign "1" if not given. The problem does not specify, so let's use "1".
   problem_statement: A natural language description of the problem.
   question_type: In this case, it's an evaluation of a line integral -> "computation" or "evaluation", but the condition for fill-in-blanks doesn't apply (only one answer). 
        However, note the condition: if fill_in_blanks and blank_count>1 then numbered. Here, it's a single answer.

   Let's set question_type to "single_answer_computation".

   math_content_check: "yes"

   final_answers:
        main_answer: type can be "number", values: [the computed value in TTS format]
        scratchwork_answer: type "step_by_step", values: [array of steps in TTS format]

 How to represent the computed value?
   The value is 172.8 * sqrt(46). We should leave it in exact form? But the problem doesn't specify. However, note that 172.8 is 864/5, so we can write as 864/5 * sqrt(46).
   But the problem says "evaluate". We can compute the decimal? However, the instructions for TTS require natural spoken language.

   Alternatively, we can leave in symbolic form? But the transformation rules require converting to spoken language.

   According to the rules:
     We have to transform exponents, etc.

   However, note that the final answer is a number? Or an expression? Since it's an evaluation, we should compute the exact value or approximate?

   The problem does not specify, so we can do exact: 864 * sqrt(46) / 5.

   How to vocalize?
     "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

   But note: 864 and 5: we can reduce? No, 864/5 is already a fraction. Alternatively, we can write as 172.8 times sqrt(46) but that is decimal.

   Since the problem has integers, we can do exact.

   Alternatively, we can compute the decimal? But the instructions don't specify. Let's do exact.

   However, the scratchwork must show the steps.

   Steps in scratchwork:

   Step 1: Parameterize the curve from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) with t from 0 to 1.
        x(t) = 6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t.

   Step 2: Compute dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1.
        ds = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) dt = sqrt(36+9+1) dt = sqrt(46) dt.

   Step 3: The integrand x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.

   Step 4: The integral becomes ∫ from 0 to 1 of (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) * sqrt(46) dt.

   Step 5: Factor sqrt(46) out: sqrt(46) * ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1.

   Step 6: Compute the integral: 
        ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = 864*(t^4/4) - 216*(t^5/5) = 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5.

   Step 7: Evaluate from 0 to 1: 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5.

   Step 8: Multiply by sqrt(46): (864/5) * sqrt(46).

   So the final answer is 864/5 * sqrt(46).

   Now, convert each step to TTS:

   Step 1: "Parameterize the curve from open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis to open parenthesis six comma three comma three close parenthesis with t going from zero to one. 
        x of t equals six t, y of t equals six minus three t, z of t equals four minus t."

   Step 2: "Compute dx dt equals six, dy dt equals negative three, dz dt equals negative one. Then, ds equals square root of open parenthesis six squared plus negative three squared plus negative one squared close parenthesis dt equals square root of open parenthesis thirty-six plus nine plus one close parenthesis dt equals square root of forty-six dt."

   Step 3: "The integrand x cubed z equals open parenthesis six t close parenthesis cubed times open parenthesis four minus t close parenthesis equals two hundred sixteen t cubed times open parenthesis four minus t close parenthesis equals eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth."

   Step 4: "The integral becomes integral from t equals zero to one of open parenthesis eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth close parenthesis times square root of forty-six dt."

   Step 5: "Factor out square root of forty-six: square root of forty-six times integral of open parenthesis eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth close parenthesis dt from zero to one."

   Step 6: "Compute the integral: 
        integral of eight hundred sixty-four t cubed dt is eight hundred sixty-four times t to the fourth over four which is two hundred sixteen t to the fourth.
        integral of negative two hundred sixteen t to the fourth dt is negative two hundred sixteen times t to the fifth over five which is negative two hundred sixteen over five t to the fifth."

   Step 7: "Evaluate from zero to one: two hundred sixteen minus two hundred sixteen over five equals open parenthesis one thousand eighty minus two hundred sixteen close parenthesis over five which equals eight hundred sixty-four over five."

   Step 8: "Multiply by square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six."

   Now, the final answer: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six"

   We can also write as a fraction: "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times the square root of forty-six", but note that 864/5 is already "eight hundred sixty-four fifths" or "eight hundred sixty-four over five".

   However, to be safe, we can say: "eight hundred sixty-four divided by five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

   But note the transformation rules: fractions are "numerator over denominator", so "eight hundred sixty-four over five" is acceptable.

   However, the main_answer type: since it's a single number, we can have an array with one string.

   Also, note that the problem_statement in natural language:

        "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed z ds along the curve C, which is the line segment from the point open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis to the point open parenthesis six comma three comma three close parenthesis."

   But we must remove all mathematical symbols? So:

        "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z times ds along the curve C, which is the line segment from the point (0,6,4) to the point (6,3,3)."

   But the instruction says "ONLY natural spoken language with ZERO mathematical symbols". So we must remove the parentheses? We can use "open parenthesis" and "close parenthesis".

   Alternatively, we can describe the points:

        "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z times ds along the curve C, which is the line segment from the point with coordinates x equals zero, y equals six, z equals four to the point with coordinates x equals six, y equals three, z equals three."

   However, the problem already says "from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)". We can convert that to:

        "from open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis to open parenthesis six comma three comma three close parenthesis"

   But note: the rules say to vocalize the comma. So we can say "from open parenthesis zero comma six comma four close parenthesis" meaning the point (0,6,4).

   Alternatively, we can say "from the point (0, 6, 4)" and then convert the parentheses? The rule for vectors and coordinates: use "open bracket" and "close bracket" for vectors? But points are similar.

   However, the universal rules have for vectors: "open bracket ... close bracket". We can use that for points? But points are typically with parentheses. But we can model as:

        "the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket"? 

   But the transformation rule says for vectors: "open bracket ... close bracket". Since the point is a coordinate vector, we can use that.

   Alternatively, the problem says "line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)" - we can convert to:

        "the line segment from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to the point open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket"

   We'll do that.

   Therefore, the problem_statement:

        "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z times ds along the curve C, which is the line segment from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to the point open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

   Now, we build the JSON.

   Note: The problem_number: we don't have one, so let's set to "1".

   Let's code accordingly.
