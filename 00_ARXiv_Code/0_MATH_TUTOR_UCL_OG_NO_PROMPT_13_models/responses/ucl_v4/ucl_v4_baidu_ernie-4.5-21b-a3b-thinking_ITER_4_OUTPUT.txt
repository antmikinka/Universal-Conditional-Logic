=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Hmm, the user has given me a complex math problem about evaluating a line integral in 3D space. Let me analyze this step by step.

The problem is: Evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). This involves vector calculus concepts specifically line integrals in space.

Looking at the system prompt, I need to:
- Convert all mathematical notation to spoken language while preserving accuracy
- Output in strict JSON format with specific fields
- Apply domain-specific transformations based on content

The universal TTS rules are particularly relevant here:
- Negative numbers become "negative [magnitude]"
- Decimals become "[integer part] point [fractional part]"
- Fractions become "[numerator] over [denominator]"
- Exponents become "[base] to the power of [exponent]"
- Square roots become "square root of [radicand]"
- Vectors become "open bracket [components] close bracket"
- Functions become "[function name] of [parameters]"

For this vector calculus problem containing "line integral", I need to apply the specific transformation rules from the <vector_calculus_notation> section. The key elements are:
- "double integral" not present
- "triple integral" absent
- "line integral" present - this is the main operation
- No surface/surface integrals

The transformation steps should be:
1. Convert the integral notation: "integral of x cubed z ds" becomes "integral over curve C of x cubed z ds"
2. Specify the curve C: "from point (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)" becomes "open bracket start point (0,6,4) comma end point (6,3,3) close bracket"
3. Break down the integral components:
   - Function: x³z → "x cubed z"
   - ds → "ds" (remains unchanged as it's the differential)
   - Path → "over curve C"

The JSON output must include:
- problem_number: "1" (as per standard convention)
- problem_statement: fully verbalized version
- question_type: "line_integral"
- math_content_check: "yes"
- final_answers with main_answer (type: "line_integral_evaluation", values: [verbalized result], answer_format: "tts_ready")
- scratchwork_answer (if any, but this is a direct computation)

I notice the physics_units section won't apply since there are no units mentioned. The statistics/probability sections are irrelevant here.

The critical part is ensuring the mathematical accuracy is preserved while converting to speech. The result should be a clear, spoken-language version of the solution that can be easily spoken back. For the line integral ∫ x³z ds along C from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), the verbalized solution would be: "integral over curve C from point zero comma six comma four to six comma three comma three of x cubed z ds".

The JSON output must strictly follow the template with all fields populated correctly. I'll structure the JSON with proper escaping and formatting to meet the requirements.
