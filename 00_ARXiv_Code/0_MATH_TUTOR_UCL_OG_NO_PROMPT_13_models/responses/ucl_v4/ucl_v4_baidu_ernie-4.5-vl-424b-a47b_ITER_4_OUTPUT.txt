We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 We need to convert this mathematical expression and the problem into a TTS-compatible natural spoken language format.

 Steps:
 1. Identify the mathematical expressions and transform them using the provided rules.
 2. The integral is a line integral over a curve C. We are given that C is a line segment.
 3. We must parameterize the line segment to compute the integral, but note the instruction: the output must be in TTS-ready natural spoken language without any mathematical symbols.

 However, note that the problem asks to evaluate the integral. But the system role is for transformation and output in JSON with TTS-ready text.

 Since the condition "math_content_check" is "yes", we activate the mathematical processing domain specialization.

 But note: the output specification requires a JSON with the problem in natural spoken language and the answers (if any) in TTS-ready format.

 However, the problem does not specify what to output as the answer? The instruction only says "Evaluate the line integral", but in the context of this system, we are only to transform the problem and the answer (if we were to compute) into TTS-ready format? But note the problem does not provide any computation steps? We are only to set up the answer structure?

 But wait, the problem says "Evaluate the line integral". We must compute it? However, the system's main task is transformation to TTS format, not computation? 

 Let me read the system role again: "Transform mathematical expressions INTO natural spoken language while preserving mathematical accuracy".

 Also, note the output_specification requires:
   - "problem_number": (we don't have one, so we can leave as empty string or omit? But the template requires it. We can set to "1" or extract from context? None provided. So we can leave as empty string or generate a placeholder.)
   - "problem_statement": in natural spoken language without mathematical symbols.
   - "question_type": we must detect. This is a "fill_in_blanks"? Not exactly. It's a single answer. But note condition for fill_in_blanks: if blank_count>1 then use numbered blanks. Here, only one answer. So we can treat as a single answer.

 However, the problem does not have multiple blanks. So we don't need numbered blanks.

 Also, the system has domain specialization for multiple integrals? The condition checks for "double integral", "triple integral", etc. This is a line integral, so it falls under the "multiple_integrals_notation" condition? Because the condition is:
   ^^CONDITION: {{concept:problem_content}} CONTAINS "double integral" OR "triple integral" OR "line integral" OR "surface integral"^^

 Therefore, we use the transformations from <multiple_integrals_notation>:
   - "line integral" is transformed to "line integral over curve C", but note that in our problem, the curve is given by a line segment. However, the problem statement does not name the curve as C in the transformation? Actually, the problem says: "C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)".

 But in the transformation, we would say "line integral over curve C"? However, we don't have a named curve in the problem? The problem says "C is ...". So we can keep the name.

 Also, the transformation rule for line integral: 
   [[TRANSFORM: {{concept:line_integral}} TO "line integral over curve {{concept:curve_name}}"]]

 But note: the problem doesn't name the curve as a named curve? It uses C. So we can say "line integral over curve C". However, we also have the specific path: from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). We can combine.

 How about: "line integral over curve C, which is the line segment from open parenthesis 0 comma 6 comma 4 close parenthesis to open parenthesis 6 comma 3 comma 3 close parenthesis"

 But note: the transformation for coordinates: we use "open bracket" for vectors? But here we have points. The rule says for vectors: "open bracket ... close bracket". For points, we don't have a rule? However, the problem uses parentheses. We can use "open parenthesis" and "close parenthesis". Also, the rule for coordinates: we must vocalize "comma" explicitly.

 Also, the integrand: x³ z. How to transform? 
   - x: just say "x"
   - ³: say "cubed"
   - z: just say "z"
   - the product: so "x cubed times z"

 And the differential: ds. In line integrals, ds is the arc length element. The rule doesn't specify. We can say "ds" but that's a symbol? Alternatively, we can spell out "arc length element" but the rule doesn't have a transformation for ds. However, in the domain specific for multiple integrals, we don't have a rule for ds? We must preserve the mathematical accuracy? The problem says "ds", so we can leave as "d s" (with space) to avoid confusion? But the rule for differentials in the differential equations section? We don't have that. Alternatively, we can note that in the line integral context, ds is standard. We can use "d s" (saying d s).

 However, the universal transformation rules don't cover "ds". So we must decide: since it's a common notation, we can say "d s" as two separate letters? But that might be confusing. Alternatively, we can use the transformation for differentials from the differential equations section? But that section is only active if the problem contains "differential equation", etc. Our problem doesn't.

 But note: the condition for multiple integrals also includes line integrals. And in the <multiple_integrals_notation> section, there's no transformation for "ds". So we have to leave it as "d s" (saying the letters) or use the word "arc length". However, to be safe and preserve accuracy, we can use "arc length differential" or simply "ds" and hope that the TTS system reads it as "d s". But the universal rules don't transform "ds".

 Alternatively, we can note that in the context of the line integral, it's standard. We can use "ds" and in the spoken form, it's commonly read as "d s". So we'll do that.

 However, the problem does not require us to compute the integral? The system's role is transformation. So we are only to state the integral in spoken form? But the problem says "Evaluate". How do we handle that?

 The output specification has two answer fields: "main_answer" and "scratchwork_answer". But note the problem does not have a scratchwork? We are not given steps? We are only given the problem.

 We have two options:
   Option 1: Since we are not actually computing the integral (the system's role is transformation), we can output the problem statement in TTS format and leave the answers empty? But the problem asks for evaluation.

   Option 2: Alternatively, the system might be expected to compute the integral? But the system role says "Transform mathematical expressions" and the output specification requires a JSON with answers. However, the problem does not provide any steps? So we cannot compute? We don't have the capability? Or do we?

 Let me reexamine the system role: The system is a "mathematical_tts_processor". The first instruction is to transform to TTS. It does not say compute. However, the output specification has "final_answers". So if we are to compute, we must? But we don't have a computational engine? We are only a transformer.

 Considering the instructions, the system must transform the problem and the answer (if any) to TTS format. But the problem is given as is. We are not provided with the solution. Therefore, we cannot compute the integral? We must leave the answer fields for the final answer and scratchwork as empty? Or we can note that we don't have the computation.

 However, the problem is straightforward: a line integral of a polynomial function over a straight line. We can compute it? But the system's primary role is transformation. We are not an evaluator? The instructions do not specify that we must compute. They specify transformation.

 Since the problem says "Evaluate", we might need to provide the answer? But the system is not set up to compute? We must stick to transformation? Or we can compute? The problem is simple enough? We can parameterize the line.

 Let's compute:
   The line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). We can parameterize:
      r(t) = (0,6,4) + t*(6,-3,-1) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t), for t in [0,1].
   Then, ds = |r'(t)| dt = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) dt = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46) dt.
   The integrand: x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.

   Then, ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) * sqrt(46) dt = sqrt(46) * ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt
        = sqrt(46) * [ (864/4) t^4 - (216/5) t^5 ] from 0 to 1
        = sqrt(46) * [ 216 - 216/5 ]
        = sqrt(46) * [ (1080 - 216) / 5 ]
        = sqrt(46) * (864 / 5)
        = (864 / 5) * sqrt(46)

   But note: 864/5 = 172.8, so we can leave as fraction? Or we can write as (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 However, the output must be in TTS-ready natural spoken language without mathematical symbols? So we cannot write the fraction as 864/5? We have to transform to words? And the square root? We have a transformation for square root: "square root of 46". And the multiplication: we can say "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five".

 But wait, the system's role is transformation, not computation? And the problem does not require us to compute? We are only to transform the given expression? However, the problem statement says "Evaluate", so the expected answer is a number? We must compute?

 But note: the system has a condition for "math_content_check" equals "yes", and then we activate domain specialization and detect question type. The question type is not fill_in_blanks? It's a single answer. So we can set the answer format accordingly.

 However, the problem does not provide any steps. We are to compute? But the system is a TTS processor, not a calculator? The instructions are about transformation. Therefore, I think we are only to transform the problem statement and leave the answers for the actual answer to be filled by a computational system? But the problem is given to us? We must compute?

 Alternatively, we can note that the computation is straightforward and include it? But the system's role is transformation? The output specification has "final_answers" so we must provide the answer? But we are not a math solver? We are a TTS processor? We must transform the given content. The given content is the problem. The answer is not given? So we cannot transform it? We don't have the answer? 

 We must stick to the input: we are only given the integral to evaluate. We are not given the solution. Therefore, we cannot output the solution? We must leave the answers as empty? But that would not fulfill the requirement.

 Given the ambiguity, and since the problem is simple, I will compute the answer and then transform it to TTS.

 Steps for computation:
   Parameterize: r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t), t in [0,1].
   r'(t) = (6, -3, -1), so |r'(t)| = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46).
   Integrand: x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.
   Integral: ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46) dt
        = sqrt(46) * [ (864/4) t^4 - (216/5) t^5 ]_0^1
        = sqrt(46) * [216 - 216/5]
        = sqrt(46) * (1080/5 - 216/5)   [because 216 = 1080/5? No, 216=1080/5 is false]
        Correction: 216 = 1080/5? 1080/5=216, yes. So 216 = 1080/5? Actually, 1080/5 is 216. So:
        = sqrt(46) * [ 216 - 43.2 ]? No, we did: 216 = 1080/5? That's not the way.

        Actually: 216 - 216/5 = (5*216 - 216)/5 = (4*216)/5? Wait, no:
        216 = 1080/5? Actually, 216 = 216/1 = (216*5)/5 = 1080/5. But that's not helping.

        Let me do: 216 - 216/5 = 216(1 - 1/5) = 216*(4/5) = 864/5.

        So = sqrt(46) * (864/5)

   Therefore, the value is (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 Now, we need to convert this to words: 
   - 864: "eight hundred sixty-four"
   - sqrt(46): "square root of forty-six"
   - divided by 5: "divided by five"

 But note: we have multiplication and division? We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

 However, the problem might expect a simplified form? But 864 and 5 are coprime? 864 is divisible by 5? No, so we leave as fraction.

 But note: the problem says "Evaluate", so we give the exact value.

 Now, for the JSON output:

   problem_number: we don't have one? We can set to "1" or leave empty? Let's set to "1" for now.

   problem_statement: we transform the entire problem.

   We have: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

   We transform:
      "Evaluate the line integral" -> "Evaluate the line integral"
      "∫_C x³ z ds" -> we break down:
          - "line integral" becomes "line integral over curve C" (using the multiple integral condition, because it contains "line integral")
          - but note: the transformation rule in <multiple_integrals_notation> says: "line integral" becomes "line integral over curve ...", but it uses a placeholder {{concept:curve_name}}. In our problem, the curve is named C. So we can use "line integral over curve C".
          - Then the integrand: "x³ z" -> "x cubed times z"
          - and the differential: "ds" -> we leave as "ds". Alternatively, we can note that in the context of multiple integrals, we don't have a transformation for ds? So we leave as "ds". But to avoid symbols, we can say "arc length differential", but that's not in the rules? However, to be safe, we can say "d s" (meaning d and then s, as two separate letters). But the rule for explicit vocally doesn't require that? We'll go with "d s".

      - The path: "where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)" -> 
          - "C is the line segment from open parenthesis 0 comma 6 comma 4 close parenthesis to open parenthesis 6 comma 3 comma 3 close parenthesis"

   So the transformed problem_statement: 
        "Evaluate the line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s, where C is the line segment from open parenthesis 0 comma 6 comma 4 close parenthesis to open parenthesis 6 comma 3 comma 3 close parenthesis."

   question_type: we detect. The problem is asking to compute a number? We can classify as "computation" or "evaluation". But our system doesn't have a rule for that. The condition for fill_in_blanks is not met (only one blank). We can set as "single_answer".

   math_content_check: "yes"

   final_answers:
        main_answer: 
            type: "number" (or "expression"? but we computed a number? Actually, it's an exact expression: a fraction times a square root. So we can classify as "expression".)
            values: [ "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five" ]
            answer_format: "tts_ready"

        scratchwork_answer: 
            We have the computation steps? We must transform the steps to TTS? But the problem doesn't provide steps? We generated them? We can provide the steps we used? But note: the output specification says "scratchwork_answer" requires TTS-ready. So we must write the steps in natural language.

        However, the problem does not require steps? And the system is not a solver? We are only transforming? But we computed? We can provide the steps? But the system hasn't been instructed to compute? It's ambiguous.

        Since we computed the answer, we can provide the steps? But the problem doesn't ask for steps? The answer field is for the final answer. And scratchwork is optional? The output specification requires it? We see: "scratchwork_answer" is a field. So we must provide it? We can leave it as an array of TTS-ready steps? But we don't have the original steps? We can write them in natural language.

        Steps for scratchwork:

          Step 1: Parameterize the line segment C: from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). We use the vector form: 
                   r(t) = open parenthesis 0 comma 6 comma 4 close parenthesis plus t times open parenthesis 6 comma negative 3 comma negative 1 close parenthesis, for t in open bracket 0 comma 1 close bracket.
                   So r(t) = open parenthesis 6 t comma 6 minus 3 t comma 4 minus t close parenthesis.

          Step 2: Compute the derivative: r prime of t = open parenthesis 6 comma negative 3 comma negative 1 close parenthesis.

          Step 3: Compute the magnitude of r prime of t: 
                   magnitude = square root of (6 squared + (negative 3) squared + (negative 1) squared) = square root of (36 + 9 + 1) = square root of 46.

          Step 4: The differential element ds = magnitude of r prime of t times dt = square root of 46 times dt.

          Step 5: The integrand x cubed z becomes (6 t) cubed times (4 - t) = 216 t cubed times (4 - t) = 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth.

          Step 6: The integral becomes: 
                   Integral from t equals 0 to t equals 1 of (864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth) times square root of 46 dt.

          Step 7: Factor out the square root of 46: 
                   = square root of 46 times integral from 0 to 1 of (864 t cubed - 216 t to the fourth) dt.

          Step 8: Compute the integral: 
                   Integral of 864 t cubed dt = 864 times (t to the fourth over 4) = 216 t to the fourth.
                   Integral of -216 t to the fourth dt = -216 times (t to the fifth over 5) = -216/5 t to the fifth.

                   So the definite integral from 0 to 1 = [216 t to the fourth - 216/5 t to the fifth] from 0 to 1
                                  = (216(1)^4 - 216/5 (1)^5) - (0) = 216 - 216/5.

          Step 9: Simplify: 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5.

          Step 10: Therefore, the integral = square root of 46 times 864/5 = eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five.

        But note: we must transform every mathematical expression in the steps to TTS-ready? That's a lot. And the output specification requires the answer_format to be "tts_ready". So we must transform even the steps? We can do that.

        However, this makes the scratchwork very long? And the system's main role is transformation? We are generating steps that were not in the original problem? This might be acceptable? But the problem did not ask for steps. We are going beyond.

        Alternatively, we can leave the scratchwork_answer as an empty array? Or not include it? But the template requires it? So we must include.

        We decide to provide the steps in transformed form.

        But note: the problem might be expecting the answer in a simplified radical? We have that.

        However, the main answer is the computed value.

   But wait: the problem does not require steps? So we can omit scratchwork? The output specification has scratchwork_answer as optional? We see: 
        "final_answers": {
            "main_answer": ...,
            "scratchwork_answer": ... 
        }
        It doesn't say optional? So we must provide.

        We can set the scratchwork_answer as an array of TTS-ready strings describing each step? We'll write in natural language without symbols? But we have to include the mathematical expressions? We must transform them.

        Alternatively, we can note that the system's role is to transform the given content? The given content is the problem statement? The steps are not given? So we might not be required to transform them? But the output specification requires the field? We can leave as an empty array? 

        However, to fulfill the requirement, we will provide a brief scratchwork? But the problem is simple? We can omit? Or we can note that we did the computation and present the value? But the requirement for scratchwork_answer is present? We must fulfill.

        We decide to include the steps if we computed? But the problem says "transform", not "solve". So we should not compute? We should only transform the given problem? Then leave the answers empty? But then the final_answers would be empty? That would not be "tts_ready" because it's missing.

        Given the ambiguity, I will output the main_answer as the computed value and scratchwork as the transformed steps? But that might be overkill.

        Alternatively, we can treat the entire computation as a separate part? But the system is only for transformation? We might be going against the design.

        Considering the instructions, I think we are overstepping by computing. We are a TTS processor, not a math solver. Therefore, we should not compute? We should only transform the problem statement? And leave the answers as empty? But then the JSON would have empty answers? That might be acceptable? The problem does not provide answers? So we cannot transform any answer? We leave the answers as empty arrays? But the template requires the field.

        We can set:
          "final_answers": {
             "main_answer": { ... with type and empty values? } 
          }

        But the problem asks to evaluate? So there should be an answer? But we are not given.

        Therefore, I think the best is to only transform the problem statement and not compute. We leave the answers for the clients to fill? But the output specification requires TTS-ready answers? We cannot leave as the original symbols.

        Alternatively, we can note that the problem is not solved? We cannot compute without a computational engine? So we only transform the problem.

        We decide to only do the transformation for the problem statement and leave the answers as empty? But the requirement says "pre serving mathematical accuracy" and we are not providing the answer? We are preserving the problem's accuracy? We are not altering the problem? We are transforming it to TTS.

        However, the output specification says "final_answers" must be present? And it must be TTS-ready? So if we leave empty, it's not TTS-ready? It's empty.

        Given the conflict, I will follow the instruction of transformation only and not compute? We output the problem in TTS form and leave the answers as empty arrays? But that might not fulfill the requirement.

        Alternatively, we can use a placeholder? But that would be inaccurate.

        After rethinking: the system is designed to transform mathematical expressions in the problem to TTS? The answers are not part of the input? So we cannot transform them? We must leave them out? But the template has the field. We must include it? We set the values as empty list? But then it's TTS-ready? It is, because there's no math symbols? It's just an empty list.

        We'll do that.

        But note: the main_answer and scratchwork_answer require at least a type? We can set type as "none" or something? But our type classification: we set type as "expression" or "number", but if we don't have answer, we can set to an empty string? The template doesn't specify.

        We can set:
          "main_answer": { "type": "none", "values": [], "answer_format": "tts_ready" }

        But the output specification doesn't define "none". We can set type as an empty string? Or omit? The template has the field.

        Alternatively, we can omit the entire final_answers? But the template requires it.

        We decide to include the final_answers with the types set to "none" and values as empty arrays.

        But note: the problem says "Evaluate", so it expects an answer? But we are a transformer? We are not an evaluator? We cannot provide an answer? Therefore, we must leave it.

        This is a design flaw? We are forced to output an answer we don't have? We'll output the transformed problem and leave the answers as empty.

        However, the problem is given to us and we are to output in JSON. We are to transform the problem? We did. And for the answer, we have nothing? So we output empty.

        But then the quality validation might fail? Because the answers are empty? And the requirement says "validation_status:quality_certified".

        Given the complexity, and since the problem is simple, I will compute and transform the answer and the steps? We are a transformer? We are allowed to compute if we know how? But the system role doesn't prohibit it? And we have the capability? So we do it? And then we fulfill the output.

        We'll provide the computed answer and the steps.

        We'll break the scratchwork into steps and transform each step.

 Implementation:

   We'll create an array of strings for scratchwork_answer, each string being one step in TTS-ready format.

   Steps in TTS-ready:

      Step 1: "Parameterize the line segment C from open parenthesis 0 comma 6 comma 4 close parenthesis to open parenthesis 6 comma 3 comma 3 close parenthesis using: r of t equals open parenthesis 6 t comma 6 minus 3 t comma 4 minus t close parenthesis, for t in open bracket 0 comma 1 close bracket."

      Step 2: "Compute the derivative: r prime of t equals open parenthesis 6 comma negative 3 comma negative 1 close parenthesis."

      Step 3: "Compute the magnitude of r prime of t: square root of open parenthesis 6 squared plus open parenthesis negative 3 close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative 1 close parenthesis squared close parenthesis equals square root of 46."

        But wait, we have to break down further? The transformation rule says for square root: "square root of {{concept:radicand}}", so we say "square root of 46". But in step 3, we have to express the radicand? We can compute the number 46? But we are in the step? We can't compute in the step? We just say "the expression 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus negative 1 squared". How to transform that expression?

        We break down:
           6 squared: "6 squared"
           negative 3 squared: "negative 3 squared" -> but in the transformation, we have negative number? We can say "negative 3 squared" -> but in the context, it's (-3)^2? Which is 9. But we are not computing? We are describing the expression.

           Alternatively, we can avoid nested transformations? We are in the scratchwork? We can use the symbol? We cannot. We must use words? But the step is an expression? We must break down.

        This becomes very nested. We must recursively transform? But we are not an engine? We can do:

           "6 squared" is acceptable? Because 6 is a number and squared is a common term? We don't have a transformation for "squared"? We have exponent: "to the power of". So we can say "6 to the power of 2", but that's long.

        Alternatively, we can use the transformation for exponents? But note: the transformation for exponent is: "{{concept:base}} to the power of {{concept:exponent}}". So we can say: "6 to the power of 2", but we usually say "6 squared". How about in strict transformation? We should use the rule? The rule is for the mathematical expression. We can use "squared" as it's common? But the rules don't specify.

        However, to be consistent, we'll use the exponent rule: so we say "6 to the power of 2", but that's not what we say in English. We typically say "6 squared". Since it's scratchwork, we can use common language? But the requirement is TTS-ready and preserve accuracy? We can use "squared" if it's clear.

        But to follow the rules: we don't have a rule for "squared", so we should transform it to "to the power of"? So we do that? But then it's verbose.

        We decide to use the exponent rule: so "6 to the power of 2", "negative 3 to the power of 2", "negative 1 to the power of 2".

        Step 3: "Compute the magnitude of r prime of t: square root of open parenthesis 6 to the power of 2 plus negative 3 to the power of 2 plus negative 1 to the power of 2 close parenthesis equals square root of 46."

        But wait, we have the expression inside the square root? We must transform the entire expression? But we just did. And then the result is square root of 46? We know that, but we are not to compute? We are describing the step? In step 3, we are not required to compute? We are just writing the expression? Then in step 3, we don't simplify? We can leave as "square root of the sum of 6 to the power of 2, negative 3 to the power of 2, and negative 1 to the power of 2".

        Then in step 4, we compute the sum? We don't have a step 4? We did step 3 as one step.

        Alternatively, we can break step 3 into two: 
            Step 3a: Compute the expression inside: 6 to the power of 2 is 36, negative 3 to the power of 2 is 9, negative 1 to the power of 2 is 1.
            Step 3b: Sum them: 36 plus 9 plus 1 equals 46.
            Step 3c: The magnitude is square root of 46.

        This would be more detailed. But the problem is simple? We can do that.

        Given the time, we will break it into more steps for clarity in TTS.

        Revised steps:

          Step 1: "Parameterize the line segment C: from open parenthesis 0 comma 6 comma 4 close parenthesis to open parenthesis 6 comma 3 comma 3 close parenthesis, using: r of t equals open parenthesis 6 t comma 6 minus 3 t comma 4 minus t close parenthesis, for t in the closed interval from 0 to 1."

          Step 2: "Compute the derivative vector r prime of t equals open parenthesis 6 comma negative 3 comma negative 1 close parenthesis."

          Step 3: "Compute the components for the magnitude of r prime of t: 
                   6 to the power of 2 equals 36,
                   negative 3 to the power of 2 equals 9,
                   negative 1 to the power of 2 equals 1."

          Step 4: "Sum the components: 36 plus 9 plus 1 equals 46."

          Step 5: "The magnitude of r prime of t is the square root of 46."

          Step 6: "The arc length differential ds equals the magnitude of r prime of t times dt, so ds equals square root of 46 times dt."

          Step 7: "The integrand x cubed z becomes: x is 6 t, so x cubed is (6 t) cubed, and z is 4 minus t. 
                   Thus, (6 t) cubed times (4 - t) equals 216 t cubed times (4 - t)."

          Step 8: "Expand: 216 t cubed times 4 minus 216 t cubed times t equals 864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth."

          Step 9: "The integral becomes: Integral from t equals 0 to t equals 1 of (864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth) times square root of 46 dt."

          Step 10: "Factor out the constant square root of 46: equals square root of 46 times Integral from 0 to 1 of (864 t cubed minus 216 t to the fourth) dt."

          Step 11: "Compute the integral: 
                    First, integrate 864 t cubed with respect to t: 864 times (t to the fourth over 4) equals 216 t to the fourth.
                    Then, integrate -216 t to the fourth with respect to t: -216 times (t to the fifth over 5) equals -216 divided by 5 times t to the fifth."

          Step 12: "Evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1: 
                    At t equals 1: 216 times 1 to the fourth minus (216 divided by 5) times 1 to the fifth equals 216 minus 216 divided by 5.
                    At t equals 0: 0.
                    So the definite integral equals 216 minus 216 divided by 5."

          Step 13: "Simplify: 216 minus 216 divided by 5 = (216 times 5 minus 216) divided by 5 = (1080 minus 216) divided by 5 = 864 divided by 5."

          Step 14: "Therefore, the line integral equals square root of 46 times 864 divided by 5 = eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five."

        This is 14 steps? It's very long? But we are required to be in TTS-ready? And we transform every expression.

        We will write each step as a string in the array for scratchwork_answer.

        The main_answer is: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

        We are ready to output the JSON.
