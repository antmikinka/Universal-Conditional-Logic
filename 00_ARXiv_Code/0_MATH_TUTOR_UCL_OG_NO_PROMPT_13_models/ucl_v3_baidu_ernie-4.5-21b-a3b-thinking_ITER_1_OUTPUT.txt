=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). First, I need to remember what a line integral of a scalar field over a curve involves. 

So, the line integral of a scalar function f(x, y, z) along a curve C parameterized by r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) from t = a to t = b is given by the integral of f(r(t)) * ||r'(t)|| dt. Here, f is x³z, and the curve C is a straight line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First step: Parameterize the curve C. Since it's a line segment, I can use a linear parameterization. Let t go from 0 to 1, so that when t=0, we're at the start point (0,6,4), and when t=1, we're at the end point (6,3,3). The parameterization would be:

x(t) = 0 + t*(6 - 0) = 6t  
y(t) = 6 + t*(3 - 6) = 6 - 3t  
z(t) = 4 + t*(3 - 4) = 4 - t  

That makes sense. Now, I need to find the derivative of each component with respect to t to get the speed, which is the magnitude of the derivative vector. Let's compute r'(t):

dx/dt = 6  
dy/dt = -3  
dz/dt = -1  

So the speed ||r'(t)|| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). That's a constant, which is good because it simplifies the integral.

Next, the function f(r(t)) is x³z. Substituting x(t) and z(t):

x³z = (6t)³*(4 - t) = 216t³*(4 - t) = 216t³*4 - 216t³*t = 864t³ - 216t⁴

Now, the line integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [864t³ - 216t⁴] * sqrt(46) dt. Since sqrt(46) is a constant, I can factor it out:

sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt

Now, integrate term by term. The integral of 864t³ is 864*(t⁴/4) = 216t⁴, and the integral of -216t⁴ is -216*(t⁵/5) = -43.2t⁵. Evaluating from 0 to 1:

At t=1: 216*(1)⁴ - 43.2*(1)⁵ = 216 - 43.2 = 172.8  
At t=0: 0 - 0 = 0  

So the integral inside is 172.8, and multiplying by sqrt(46) gives the final result. Let me check the math again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute the integral. The integral of 864t³ is (864/4)t⁴ = 216t⁴, and the integral of -216t⁴ is (-216/5)t⁵. So at t=1, 216*1 - (216/5)*1 = 216 - 43.2 = 172.8. That's correct. Then multiply by sqrt(46). So the final answer should be 172.8√46. Let me confirm if that's the simplest form or if it can be simplified further. Since 46 is 2*23, which are both primes, it can't be simplified more. So the answer is 172.8√46.
