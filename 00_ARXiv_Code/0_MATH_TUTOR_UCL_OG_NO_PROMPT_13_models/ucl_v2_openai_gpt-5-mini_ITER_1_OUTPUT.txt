**Calculating integral details**

I'm working on finding the integral of the function \(x^3 z\), specifically \(216t^3(4 - t)\). I need to calculate the integral from 0 to 1, which involves evaluating parts of the function, breaking it down, and ensuring the coefficients are correct. After some checking, I confirm results like \(216 - 43.2 = 172.8\). So, I’ll multiply this by \(\sqrt{46}\) to find the final result expressed also as a fraction.**Setting up output parameters**

I need to ensure that the output includes a "problem_number," and since none was provided, I can default it to "1." The "problem_statement" must be in natural language without any math symbols, so I'll phrase it as: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length along the curve C, where C is the line segment from the point zero comma six comma four to six comma three comma three." I need to remember to apply the necessary transformations for verbalizing numbers and expressions correctly, while also considering the classification of this question as a line integral in vector calculus.**Preparing answer format**

I'll set the classification as "vector_calculus," confirming math content is included. The main answer type should align with this classification, and since we're dealing with vector calculus, the answer type will be "single_value." 

For the output, I need an explicit string that follows TTS transformation rules. It should be something like "Eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six," making sure to include comma vocalization where specified. It's all about clarity as I prepare this string to ensure it meets expectations!**Creating TTS scratchwork**

I need to ensure that the scratchwork answer is in array format, providing a step-by-step process in TTS format, leaving out symbols. 

First, I’ll parameterize the line segment as: "r of t equals the point zero comma six comma four plus t times the vector six comma negative three comma negative one, for t from zero to one." 

Then, I’ll clarify that "x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t," and state that "the derivative of r with respect to t equals the vector six comma negative three comma negative one." Lastly, I’ll mention the speed calculation as "the square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one equals the square root of forty-six."**Formulating the problem and answers**

I'm preparing the output for a math problem concerning a line integral. I need to express the integrand as "the quantity six t to the power of three times the quantity four minus t" and ensure there are no math symbols. 

Next, I'll say the integral of "eight hundred sixty-four t to the power of three minus two hundred sixteen t to the power of four" times "the square root of forty-six." 

After computing the antiderivative, I'll express the result appropriately and focus on organizing my JSON output. It must contain all specified fields and ensure proper TTS formatting!
