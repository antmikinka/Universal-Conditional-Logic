**Working through parameters and integrands**

I’m breaking this down into steps. First, I'll parameterize the line segment: \( r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) \) with \( t \) from 0 to 1. Next, I need to compute the derivative \( r'(t) = (6, -3, -1) \) and its magnitude, which is \( \sqrt{46} \). After that, I’ll express the integrand, which is \( x^3 z = (6t)^3(4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4 \).**Clarifying integrand steps**

Let's refine the expression. I have \( x = 6t \) and \( z = 4 - t \), leading to \( x^3 z = 216t^3(4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4 \). So I should confirm that phrasing "216" is right, but I prefer conveying the steps clearly. Maybe I can say: "x cubed z equals (6t) to the power of 3 times (4 - t), resulting in 864t^3 - 216t^4." After this, the integral will be the magnitude \( \sqrt{46} \) times the integral from 0 to 1 of \( 864t^3 - 216t^4 \) dt.**Computing the integral**

For step 5, I need to compute the integral. It’s \( \sqrt{46} \) times the difference between \( \frac{864t^4}{4} \) and \( \frac{216t^5}{5} \), evaluated from 0 to 1. This will give me \( \sqrt{46} \) times \( 216 - \frac{216}{5} \). To avoid decimals, I prefer to keep it in fractions, so I have \( 216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \). Therefore, I can express it as \( \sqrt{46} \) times \( \frac{864}{5} \).**Preparing the final output**

In step 6, I need to finalize the expression as \( \frac{864}{5} \times \sqrt{46} \). I should present this in a single string format, saying, “the quantity \( \frac{864}{5} \times \sqrt{46} \)” to meet the nesting depth requirement. I’ll craft the JSON, making sure to be careful with commas and quotes to ensure it’s valid. It’s time to get that all set up without any additional commentary!
