**Calculating an integral**

I'm working through integral calculations. The integral I'm focusing on is the norm of r prime, multiplied by the integral from zero to one of some polynomial: \(864t^3 - 216t^4\). So, I first compute the integral of \(864t^3\) and find it's \(216t^4\); for \(216t^4\), it's \(216/5t^5\). After evaluating from zero to one, I subtract and simplify it, resulting in \(864/5\). It’s interesting how all the math connects!**Formatting a final answer**

I’m working on presenting the final answer while avoiding numerals. The output requires using natural language, so I'll write out numbers like "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six." I'll ensure all JSON fields are included, specifying the question type, math content check, and the main answer as a scalar value. I’ll also list the scratch work values in an array that captures my steps. It’s tricky, but I think I’m on the right track!**Ensuring JSON validity**

I need to make sure the "problem_statement" includes the original math, but in plain language. So, I will write something like, "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length over curve C, where C is the line segment from the point zero, six, four to the point six, three, three." I must ensure there are no mathematical symbols as well. After that, I’ll check the JSON format for validity. It’s all about clarity!
