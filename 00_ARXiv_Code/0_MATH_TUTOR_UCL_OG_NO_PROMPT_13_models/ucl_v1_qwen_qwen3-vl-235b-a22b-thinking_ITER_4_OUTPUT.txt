=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I need to recall how to compute line integrals with respect to arc length. 

So, for a line integral ∫_C f(x,y,z) ds, the formula is ∫_a^b f(r(t)) ||r'(t)|| dt, where r(t) is the parameterization of the curve C from t=a to t=b.

First step: parameterize the line segment. The line segment from point A (0,6,4) to point B (6,3,3) can be parameterized using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The direction vector is B - A = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parametric equations would be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

So r(t) = <6t, 6-3t, 4 - t>, where t ∈ [0,1].

Next, compute the derivative r'(t):

r'(t) = <6, -3, -1>

Then, the magnitude of r'(t) is ||r'(t)|| = sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). That's a constant, which is good because it simplifies the integral.

Now, substitute x(t), z(t), and ds into the integral. Remember ds = ||r'(t)|| dt = sqrt(46) dt.

The integrand x³ z becomes (6t)^3 * (4 - t). Let's compute that:

(6t)^3 = 216 t³, so the integrand is 216 t³ (4 - t) = 216*(4t³ - t^4).

So the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [216*(4t³ - t^4)] * sqrt(46) dt.

Factor out the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t^4) dt.

Now compute the integral of (4t³ - t^4) dt from 0 to1.

Integrate term by term:

∫4t³ dt = 4*(t^4 /4) = t^4

∫t^4 dt = t^5 /5

So the integral becomes [t^4 - (t^5)/5] from 0 to1.

At t=1: 1^4 - (1^5)/5 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

At t=0: 0 -0 =0

So the integral is 4/5 - 0 =4/5.

Multiply by the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (216 *4 /5) * sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the arithmetic. 216 *4 is 864, yes. So 864/5 is 172.8, but we can leave it as a fraction.

So the final answer should be (864/5)√46.

Let me verify the steps again to make sure.

Parameterization correct? From (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so when t=0, it's the start point, t=1 is the end. Yes.

r'(t) components: derivative of 6t is 6, 6-3t derivative is -3, 4 -t derivative is -1. Correct.

||r'(t)|| = sqrt(6² + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46). Correct.

x(t)^3 z(t) = (6t)^3*(4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t). Correct.

Integral becomes 216 sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t^4) dt. Correct.

Integral of 4t³ is t^4, integral of t^4 is t^5/5, so evaluated from 0 to1 gives (1 -1/5) =4/5. Correct.

Multiply 216 *4/5 = 864/5. So 864/5 sqrt(46). Yes, that seems right.

I think that's the answer.
