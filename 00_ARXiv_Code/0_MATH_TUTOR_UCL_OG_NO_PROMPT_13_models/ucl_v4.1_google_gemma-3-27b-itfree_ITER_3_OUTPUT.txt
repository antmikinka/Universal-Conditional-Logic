        "Now, substitute x equals 6t and z equals 4 plus t into the integrand x cubed z, which gives us open bracket 6t close bracket cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket, which simplifies to 216 t cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket, which equals 864 t cubed plus 216 t to the power of 4.",
