I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). First, I recall that for a line integral with respect to arc length, I need to parameterize the curve and then integrate the function times the magnitude of the derivative of the position vector with respect to the parameter.

So, let's parameterize the line segment. The starting point is A(0,6,4) and the ending point is B(6,3,3). I can write a vector equation for the line segment. Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and when t=1, we're at B.

So, the parametric equations are:

x = 0 + (6-0)t = 6t

y = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t

z = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

Let me double-check that. From (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so delta x = 6, delta y = 3-6 = -3, delta z = 3-4 = -1. Yes, so:

x(t) = 0 + 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

For t from 0 to 1.

Now, I need the speed, which is the magnitude of the derivative of the position vector.

The position vector r(t) = <6t, 6-3t, 4-t>

So, r'(t) = <6, -3, -1>

The magnitude |r'(t)| is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

Since it's a line segment, the speed is constant, so |r'(t)| is constant at sqrt(46).

Now, the line integral is ∫_C f(x,y,z) ds, and ds = |r'(t)| dt, so ∫ f(r(t)) |r'(t)| dt from t=a to t=b.

Here, f(x,y,z) = x³z, so I need to plug in the parametric equations.

x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t, so f(r(t)) = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t) = 864 t³ - 216 t⁴

x³ is (6t)^3 = 216 t^3, times z is 4-t, so yes, 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.

And |r'(t)| = sqrt(46)

So, the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of [864 t^3 - 216 t^4] * sqrt(46) dt

Since sqrt(46) is constant, I can pull it out of the integral.

So, sqrt(46) ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt

Now, I can factor out common factors. Notice that 864 and 216 have a common factor. Both divisible by 216? 864 ÷ 216 = 4, and 216 ÷ 216 = 1, so actually:

864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 t^3 (4 - t)

But since 216 is a constant, I can write it as:

Set k = sqrt(46) * 216, but maybe it's better to factor out the constants.

I can write the integral as:

sqrt(46) ∫_0^1 [864 t^3 - 216 t^4] dt = sqrt(46) [864 ∫ t^3 dt - 216 ∫ t^4 dt] from 0 to 1

Since it's a definite integral, I can compute it directly.

First, find the antiderivative.

Antiderivative of 864 t^3 is 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4

864 / 4 = 216, yes.

Antiderivative of -216 t^4 is -216 * (t^5 / 5) = - (216/5) t^5

So, the antiderivative is 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5

I can factor out 216: 216 [ t^4 - (1/5) t^5 ]

Now, evaluate from 0 to 1.

At t=1: 216 [1^4 - (1/5)(1)^5] = 216 [1 - 1/5] = 216 * (4/5) = (216 * 4) / 5

At t=0: 216 [0 - 0] = 0

So, the integral of the expression is 216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5

216 * 4 = 864, yes, divided by 5, so 864/5.

But this is without the sqrt(46), and also I have the coefficient.

Recall: I have sqrt(46) times that integral.

The integral was ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = 864/5 ? No.

From above, the antiderivative evaluated is 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5 at 1 minus at 0: 216 - 216/5 = (216 * 5 - 216)/5 = 216(5-1)/5 = 216 * 4 / 5 = 864/5.

But 864/5 is 172.8, but let me keep fractional.

864/5.

But this is the value of ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1, but actually in my expression, it's part of the integral without sqrt(46).

I have:

The integral of the function part is ∫ f(r(t)) dt part, but no.

Earlier:

I have ∫ f(r(t)) |r'(t)| dt = ∫ [864 t^3 - 216 t^4] * sqrt(46) dt from 0 to 1

And ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = 864/5 ? No, I got 864/5 for the antiderivative difference, but that was without the constant.

From above, ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = [216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5 ]_0^1 = 216(1) - 216/5 = 216 - 43.2 = 172.8? Better to compute as fractions.

216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5? 216 * 5 / 5 = 1080/5, minus 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5, yes.

216 is 1080/5? 216 = 1080/5? 1080/5 = 216, yes. So 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5.

So, ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = 864/5.

But 864/5 is 172.8, but actually, since I have this multiplied by sqrt(46), so the whole integral is sqrt(46) * (864/5)

I can write it as (864 / 5) * sqrt(46)

But 864 and 5 are constants, and I can simplify.

Notice that in the antiderivative, I had 216 [t^4 - (1/5) t^5], but earlier I factored.

Since I have 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 t^3 (4 - t), as I thought earlier.

And integral of that is 216 ∫_0^1 t^3 (4 - t) dt = 216 ∫_0^1 (4 t^3 - t^4) dt

Which is what I have.

Now, ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = [4*(t^4/4) - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

I think I messed up.

4 ∫ t^3 dt = 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4? No.

∫ 4 t^3 dt = 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4? That's not right.

∫ 4 t^3 dt = 4 * ∫ t^3 dt = 4 * (t^4 / 4) = t^4, yes.

And ∫ -t^4 dt = - (t^5 / 5)

So yes, [t^4 - (1/5) t^5 ]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

But earlier I had 216 times that, so 216 * (4/5) = 864/5, same as before.

But 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, yes.

Since the integral is 216 * ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = 216 * (4/5) = 864/5? No:

∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 4/5, as above, and I have 216 times that, so yes 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, but that's the value of ∫ f(r(t)) dt part, but without |r'(t)|.

Recall:

f(r(t)) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

And |r'(t)| = sqrt(46)

So f(r(t)) |r'(t)| = (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46)

So ∫ this dt from 0 to 1 = sqrt(46) ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = sqrt(46) * (864/5) as above.

Since 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 t^3 (4 - t), and I have that, but I need to multiply by sqrt(46), so:

Total integral = sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5) ? No.

∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 4/5, as above, but 4t^3 - t^4 is not f(r(t)), f(r(t)) is 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216 (4t^3 - t^4)? 216 * 4t^3 = 864 t^3, 216 * (-t^4) = -216 t^4, yes exactly.

But in the expression for the integral, it's ∫ f(r(t)) dt part, but with |r'(t)| outside, so yes.

Since |r'(t)| is constant, the integral is |r'(t)| times ∫ f(r(t)) dt from 0 to 1.

∫ f(r(t)) dt from 0 to 1 = ∫_0^1 216 t^3 (4 - t) dt = 216 ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 216 * [t^4 - (1/5)t^5]_0^1 = 216 * (1 - 1/5) = 216 * 4/5 = 864/5

Now multiply by |r'(t)| = sqrt(46), so total integral is sqrt(46) * 864 / 5

I can write it as (864 / 5) sqrt(46)

But perhaps I can simplify this fraction.

First, 864 and 5, 5 is prime, 864 divided by 5 is not integer, but it's fine.

864 and 46, 46 is 2*23, 864 is divisible by 2? 864 / 2 = 432, but I have sqrt(46), which is irrational, so probably this is the simplest form, but I can write it as a single fraction.

Since sqrt(46) is there, and 864/5, I can leave it, but maybe I can simplify constants.

Notice that in the antiderivative part, I had 864/5, but 864 and 5 have no common factors, and 46 has no squares, so sqrt(46) is already simplified.

But 864 can be simplified with the denominator? No.

Another way: since I have 216 * 4/5 * sqrt(46) = (216 * 4 / 5) sqrt(46) = (864 / 5) sqrt(46)

But 216 and 5 are coprime, 864 and 5 are coprime since 864 not divisible by 5? 864 ends with 4, not 0 or 5, so yes.

I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But 864/5 is 172.8, but better as fraction.

Notice that in the beginning, I had f(r(t)) = 216 t^3 (4 - t), and |r'(t)| = sqrt(46), so integral is sqrt(46) * 216 ∫_0^1 t^3 (4 - t) dt

Now ∫_0^1 t^3 (4 - t) dt = ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - \frac{1}{5}t^5]_0^1 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 = 4/5

So yes.

216 * 4/5 = 864/5, times sqrt(46), so \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But I recall that in the magnitude, when I computed |r'(t)| = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46), that's correct.

Now, is there a way to write this more nicely? Perhaps factor out common factors.

Notice that 864 and 46, but 46 is under square root, and 864 is integer.

I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But maybe I can reduce the fraction. What are factors of 864?

864 divided by 2 is 432, again 216, 108, 54, 27, so 864 = 8 * 108, better: 864 = 2^5 * 3^3? 2^5=32, 32*27=864? 30*27=810, 2*27=54, total 864, yes, 2^5 * 3^3.

46 = 2 * 23, so 864/5 * sqrt(46) = 864 sqrt(46) / 5

Now, sqrt(46) = sqrt(2*23), so overall, \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but 864 and 5 share no common factors, and denominator 5.

Since the speed is constant, I could compute the length of the curve.

What's the length of the line segment? From (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), delta x=6, delta y=-3, delta z=-1, so distance = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), same as speed magnitude, and since it's straight line, length is sqrt(46).

But for line integral, it's not just length, I need to integrate the function along it.

I could parameterize with arc length, but it might be more complicated.

Another way: since it's a straight line, the integral depends on the values, but I think my parameterization is fine.

Now, back to the integral: \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But 864/5 is 172.8, times sqrt(46), sqrt(46) is about sqrt(49)=7, but 46 is less, sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, so about 6.78? But better to leave exact.

Notice that in the function, x^3 z, and along the line, but I think I have to compute it.

Earlier I have f(r(t)) = x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t)

And ds = |r'(t)| dt = sqrt(46) dt

So integral is \int_0^1 216 t^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46}  dt

Which is \sqrt{46} \cdot 216 \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = \sqrt{46} \cdot 216 \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot ? No, \int (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 is [t^4 - \frac{1}{5}t^5]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

216 times 4/5 is 864/5, same.

216 * 4 / 5 = 864/5, yes.

But 216 and 5 no common factors, so total is \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, perhaps simplify by factoring out squares, but 864 is integer, 46 has no square factors, so this is simplified.

Notice that 864 / 5, but 864 and 5 are coprime, so yes.

Another thought: when I computed \int_0^1 t^3 (4 - t) dt = \int_0^1 4t^3 - t^4 dt = 4*(1/4) - 1/5? No, as above.

Set u = t, but it's fine.

I think I made a mistake in the constant.

x(t) = 6t, at t=0, x=0, t=1, x=6, good.

z(t)=4-t, at t=0, z=4, t=1, z=3, good.

f = x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, yes.

|r'(t)| = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), yes.

Integral of (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1.

Antiderivative: 864 * (t^4/4) = 216 t^4

Minus 216 * (t^5/5) = - (216/5) t^5

So [216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 ]_0^1 = 216 - \frac{216}{5} = 216 (1 - 1/5) = 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, same.

Then multiply by |r'(t)|, but |r'(t)| is not inside, it's separate, so yes, times sqrt(46).

In the line integral, it's \int f  ds = \int f(r(t)) |r'(t)| dt, so yes, f(r(t)) |r'(t)| is already multiplied, so when I integrate, it's \int [216 t^3 (4-t) \sqrt{46}] dt, no.

f(r(t)) is 216 t^3 (4-t), which is 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, and I multiply by |r'(t)| = sqrt(46), so the integrand is (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46)

Then \int_0^1 of that dt.

Since sqrt(46) is constant, it's sqrt(46) times \int (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = sqrt(46) * (864/5)

And 864/5 is 172.8, but as fraction 864/5.

Perhaps I can factor out 216 earlier.

Notice that 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 t^3 (4 - t)

So integral is \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 t^3 (4 - t) dt = \sqrt{46} * 216 \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt

Now \int_0^1 4t^3 dt = 4 * [t^4/4]_0^1 = [t^4]_0^1 = 1 - 0 = 1

\int_0^1 -t^4 dt = - [t^5/5]_0^1 = -1/5

I am considering the antiderivative again.

\int (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 4*(t^4/4) - (t^5/5) = t^4 - \frac{1}{5} t^5

At 1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

At 0: 0

So yes, 4/5

So \int (4t^3 - t^4) dt = 4/5? No, from 0 to 1 is 4/5, but that's the value, not the antiderivative.

The value of the integral \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - \frac{1}{5} t^5]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

Then 216 times that is 216 * 4/5 = 864/5

Then times sqrt(46), so same as before.

Since 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, and 864/5 * sqrt(46)

But 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, yes.

I could write 216 as 216/1, but it's fine.

Another way: 216 * \frac{4}{5} \sqrt{46} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

Perhaps simplify by noticing that the length is sqrt(46), but the function depends on t, so I need to integrate.

I could use the variable s, arc length, but parameterize with s.

At t=0, s=0, at t=1, s = length = sqrt(46)

The derivative dr/dt = <6,-3,-1>, magnitude sqrt(46), so ds/dt = sqrt(46), so s = \int ds = \int sqrt(46) dt, from t=0 to t, s = sqrt(46) t

Since ds/dt = constant, s = \int_0^t sqrt(46) dt' = sqrt(46) t

Is that right? ds/dt = |dr/dt| = sqrt(46), so yes, s = sqrt(46) t

When t=0, s=0, t=1, s=sqrt(46)

Now, x(t) = 6t, but s = sqrt(46) t, so t = s / sqrt(46)

Thus x(s) = 6 * (s / sqrt(46)) = (6 / sqrt(46)) s

Similarly, z(t) = 4 - t, so z(s) = 4 - s / sqrt(46)

Now, the function f = x^3 z = [ (6 / sqrt(46)) s ]^3 * [4 - s / sqrt(46) ]

That looks messy.

x(s) = 6 s / sqrt(46)

z(s) = 4 - s / sqrt(46)

f(s) = x^3 z = [ (6 / sqrt(46)) s ]^3 * [4 - s / sqrt(46)] 

= (216 / 46^{3/2} ) s^3 * [4 - s / sqrt(46)] 

Since sqrt(46)^3 = (46)^{3/2} = 46 * sqrt(46)

Now, 46 = 46, so f(s) = 216 / (46^{3/2}) s^3 (4 - s / sqrt(46))

Now, s / sqrt(46) = s * 46^{-1/2}

So f(s) = 216 / 46^{3/2} s^3 (4 - 46^{-1/2} s)

= 216 / 46^{3/2} [4 s^3 - 46^{-1/2} s^4 ]

Now, 46^{-1/2} s^4 = s^4 / sqrt(46)

But this looks worse, and I have to integrate with respect to s from 0 to sqrt(46).

But it's more complicated, with s^4 terms and denominators, whereas in my previous approach, I had no denominators in t.

So probably better to stick with t parameterization.

Back to my calculation: I have total integral as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But is this simplified? I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, 864 and 5 have no common factors, and 46 and 864, but since it's multiplied, and sqrt(46) is irrational, it's fine.

Notice that 864 / 5 * sqrt(46) = (864 sqrt(46)) / 5

I can factor out 864, but perhaps reduce 864 and the denominator, but denominator is 5, so no.

Another thought: in the antiderivative, I had 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5, but that's for the integral of f(r(t)) dt part without |r'|.

For the full integral, since |r'| is constant, and I have it.

Let's calculate numerically to verify.

Let me compute a few points.

When t=0, x=0, z=4, but at t=0, the start, but at start, as t->0+, x^3 z =0 since x=0, so f=0.

At t=1, x=6, z=3, f=6^3 *3=216*3=648

| r' | = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46)≈6.7823

Now, the function f(r(t)) = x^3 z = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

At t=0.5, x=3, z=4-0.5=3.5, f=3^3 *3.5=27*3.5=94.5

Compute 864*(0.5)^3 - 216*(0.5)^4 = 864*0.125 - 216*0.0625 = 108 - 13.5 = 94.5, yes.

| r' | is constant, so the integrand is f * |r'| = 94.5 * sqrt(46) ≈ 94.5 * 6.7823 ≈ let's see, 95*6.7823≈644.3185, but 94.5 is less, say 94.5*6.7823.

Since it's a polynomial, and I have the integral as sum of terms.

From my calculation, ∫ f dt part is 864/5 = 172.8, then times |r'| ≈6.7823, so 172.8 * 6.7823 ≈ let's compute: 170*6.7823≈1152.991, and 2.8*6.7823≈19.00044, total approx 1172, but this is for f dt, but I need f ds, which is f |r'| dt, so I have ∫ f |r'| dt = |r'| ∫ f dt, and I have ∫ f dt = 864/5 ≈172.8, but this is ∫ f(r(t)) dt, which is not the line integral; the line integral is ∫ f ds = ∫ f |r'| dt, so it should be larger.

In my case, I have ∫ [f(r(t)) |r'(t)|] dt = ∫ [(864 t^3 - 216 t^4) * sqrt(46)] dt

At t=0.5, this is 94.5 * 6.7823 ≈ let's calculate: 94.5 * 6.7823

First, 100*6.7823=678.23, so 94.5*6.7823 = 100*6.7823 - 5.5*6.7823 = 678.23 - 37.30265 ≈ 640.92735

But this is at a point, not integral.

The integral from 0 to 1 should be some value.

My calculation gives total integral as sqrt(46) * 864/5 ≈ 6.7823 * 172.8 ≈ let's compute: 6.7823 * 170 = 6.7823*100=678.23, 6.7823*70=474.761, total 1152.991, then 6.7823*2.8=19.00044, total approx 1172, as I had earlier.

Since at t=1, f=648, and |r'|=6.7823, but it's average or something.

But at t=0, integrand is 0, at t=1, 648*6.7823≈4400? 600*6.7823=4069.38, 48*6.7823≈325.5504, total 4394.9304, but at midpoint it's about 640, which is less, but since it's a polynomial, and I have the integral.

From the expression, the integrand is a quartic polynomial times constant, so integrable.

But in my calculation, I think it's correct, but let me see if I missed a factor.

Another way: the line integral is ∫ x^3 z ds along the line.

I can express everything in terms of x or z.

For example, in terms of x.

x from 0 to 6.

Parametric: x=6t, so t=x/6

y=6-3t=6-3(x/6)=6 - x/2? t=x/6, y=6 -3(x/6)=6-0.5x

z=4-t=4 - x/6

Now, ds: but I need ds in terms of dx.

Since it's a line, ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt, but in terms of x.

dx/dt =6, as before.

dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1

So |dr/dt| = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(46), same.

Now, in terms of x, since dx/dt =6, so dt/dx = 1/6

Then ds/dx = |dr/dt| / |dx/dt| ? Speed in x-direction, but generally.

The speed magnitude |dr/dt| is ds/dt.

ds/dt = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46)

Since dx/dt =6, so ds/dx = (ds/dt) / (dx/dt) ? No.

dx/dt = rate of change, so for a small dx, dt = dx / (dx/dt) = dx /6

Then ds = |dr/dt| dt = sqrt(46) * (dx /6)

So ds = \frac{\sqrt{46}}{6} dx

Now, x from 0 to 6.

f = x^3 z

z in terms of x: z = 4 - t, t=x/6, so z=4 - x/6

Thus f(x) = x^3 (4 - x/6) = x^3 * (24 - x)/6 ? 4 - x/6 = (24 - x)/6

So f(x) = x^3 * \frac{24 - x}{6} = \frac{ x^3 (24 - x) }{6}

Now, ds = \frac{\sqrt{46}}{6} dx

So the line integral is ∫ f(x) ds = ∫_{x=0}^{6} \left[ \frac{ x^3 (24 - x) }{6} \right] \cdot \frac{\sqrt{46}}{6} dx

Simplify: first, \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{46}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{46}}{36}

And the function is \frac{ x^3 (24 - x) }{6} ? No.

f(x) is the scalar function, but it's already f times ds, so integral is ∫ [f(x)] * [ds/dx] dx, but ds/dx is already included, no.

Standard: line integral ∫ f ds = ∫ f(x) \cdot (ds/dx) dx

Here, f(x) is the function value at x, but f is a function of x,y,z, but here I have expressed f in terms of x only, since y and z are functions of x along the line.

Since we're on the line, yes, f is a function of x, so γ(x) = f(x,y(x),z(x)) = x^3 z(x) = x^3 (4 - x/6), as above.

So γ(x) = x^3 (4 - x/6) = \frac{ x^3 (24 - x) }{6}

As above.

Then ds/dx = \frac{ds}{dx} = \frac{ \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 + (dz)^2 } }{dx} , but since constant, or from earlier, ds/dx = \frac{ |dr/dt| }{ dx/dt } = \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{6}

Since |dr/dt| = ds/dt, dx/dt=6, so ds/dx = (ds/dt) / (dx/dt) = sqrt(46) / 6

Yes.

So now, integral ∫ γ(x) ds = ∫_{x=0}^{6} γ(x) \frac{ds}{dx} dx = ∫_0^6 \left[ \frac{ x^3 (24 - x) }{6} \right] \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{6} dx

Simplify: the constants: \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{\sqrt{46}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{46}}{36}

And the function is \frac{ x^3 (24 - x) }{6} ? No:

γ(x) = \frac{ x^3 (24 - x) }{6}

But in the integral, it's γ(x) multiplied by ds/dx, so:

∫ [ \frac{ x^3 (24 - x) }{6} ] \times \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{6} dx = \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} \int_0^6 x^3 (24 - x) dx

Now, simplify: \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} \int_0^6 (24 x^3 - x^4) dx

Now, compute the integral: antiderivative of 24x^3 is 24 * (x^4 / 4) = 6 x^4

Antiderivative of -x^4 is - (x^5 / 5)

So [6 x^4 - \frac{1}{5} x^5 ]_0^6

At x=6: 6*(1296) - (1/5)*7776? x^4=6^4=1296, x^5=7776

So 6*1296 = 7776

Minus (1/5)*7776 = 7776 / 5 = 1555.2? Better as fractions.

x=6, so 6^4=1296, 6*1296=7776

x^5=7776

So [6x^4 - \frac{1}{5} x^5] at 6: 6*1296 - \frac{1}{5}*7776 = 7776 - 7776/5

= 7776 (1 - 1/5) = 7776 * 4/5

At 0: 0

So ∫ = 7776 * 4 / 5

Now, 7776 / 5 * 4 = but 7776 * 4 / 5

Now, back to integral: \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} * \frac{7776 \times 4}{5} ? No

The integral is \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} \times \text{integral of } (24x^3 - x^4) dx from 0 to 6 = \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} \times (7776 * 4 / 5)

Since ∫ = 7776 * 4 / 5

Now, 7776 * 4 / 5

But 7776 / 5? Better compute numerically or simplify.

Note that 7776 and 36.

First, compute ∫ = 7776 * 4 / 5 = 31104 / 5

7776 * 4 = 31104, yes, divided by 5.

Now, so integral is \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} \times \frac{31104}{5} = \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36 \times 5} \times 31104 = \frac{ \sqrt{46} \times 31104 }{180}

Now, simplify 31104 / 180

First, divide numerator and denominator.

Note that 31104 / 180

But earlier in t parameterization, I had \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Compare: \frac{ \sqrt{46} \times 31104 }{180}

Now, 31104 / 180

First, simplify fraction.

Both divisible by... 180=18*10, 31104 divisible by 16? Or find gcd.

Note that 31104 / 180 = 31104 ÷ 36 / 180 ÷ 36? Better compute step by step.

In my first calculation, I had 864/5 * sqrt(46)

864/5 ≈172.8, times sqrt(46)≈6.7823≈1172. something

Now here, \frac{ \sqrt{46} \times 31104 }{180} = \sqrt{46} \times \frac{31104}{180}

Compute 31104 / 180.

First, 180 * 172 = 180*100=18000, 180*72=12960, total 18000+12960=30960, subtract from 31104: 31104-30960=144

So 172 + 144/180 = 172 + 16/20? 144/180=144÷36=4, 180÷36=5? 144÷12=12, 180÷12=15, so 12/15=4/5? 144/180=144÷36=4, 180÷36=5, yes 4/5? 144÷36=4, but 36*4=144, yes, and 180÷36=5, so 144/180=4/5? 4/5=0.8, 144/180=0.8, yes.

So 31104/180 = 172 + 0.8 = 172.8, exactly? 172.8 = 1728/10=864/5? 172.8 = 1728/10, but 1728/10=864/5? 864/5=172.8, yes!

Because 864÷5=172.8, yes.

So 31104 / 180 = 172.8 = 864 / 5? 864/5=172.8, but 31104/180, let's see: 31104 ÷ 36 = 864? 36*864.

36*800=28800, 36*64=2304, total 28800+2304=31104, yes! And 180 ÷ 36 = 5? 180 / 36 = 5, yes.

So 31104 / 180 = (31104 / 36) / (180 / 36) = 864 / 5, exactly.

So \frac{31104}{180} = \frac{864}{5}

Thus the integral is \frac{ \sqrt{46} \times 864 }{5} , same as before.

So back to \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, perhaps I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but I think this is the answer.

Notice that in the constant, 216 appeared, and 216 * 4 = 864, but same.

I could factor out 432 or something, but no.

Since 46 is under square root, and 864 is integer, and 864/5 is fractional, but it's acceptable.

Another way: simplify by factoring out squares, but 46=2*23, no squares, 864=2^5 * 3^3, so the fraction is already simplified.

So I think \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} is the answer.

But let me confirm the integral value.

From the expression, I can compute exactly.

We had \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} \int_0^6 (24x^3 - x^4) dx = \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} \times [24 \frac{x^4}{4} - \frac{x^5}{5} ]_0^6 = \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} [6 x^4 - \frac{1}{5} x^5 ]_0^6

As before, at x=6: 6*(1296) - \frac{1}{5}*7776 = 7776 - 1555.2 = but in fractions: 6*1296=7776, \frac{1}{5}*7776=1555.2? 7776/5=1555.2, but better 7776 - 7776/5 = 7776 (1 - 1/5) = 7776 * 4 / 5

7776 / 5 * 4 = 31104 / 5? 7776 * 4 = 31104, yes, so 31104 / 5

Then multiplied by \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} 

So \frac{ \sqrt{46} }{36} \times \frac{31104}{5} = \frac{ \sqrt{46} \times 31104}{180}

Now, 31104 / 180

Simplify: both divisible by 12? Or as before, 31104 ÷ 36 = 864, 180 ÷ 36 = 5, so \frac{31104}{180} = \frac{864}{5}

Thus \frac{ \sqrt{46} \times 864}{5} same.

31104 / 180 = 31104 ÷ 12 / 180 ÷ 12? 180÷12=15, 31104÷12=2592? 12*2592=31104? 12*2500=30000, 12*92=1104, total 31104, yes. So 2592 / 15

2592 ÷ 3 = 864, 15 ÷ 3? 15/3 not integer. 2592 / 15 = 2592 ÷ 3 / 15 ÷ 3? Better: 2592 / 15 = 2592 ÷ 3 / 5 = 864 / 5? 2592 ÷ 3 = 864, 15÷3=5, yes, so 864/5 again.

So indeed.

Therefore, the line integral is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5

==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), parameterize the curve using a parameter \(t\) from 0 to 1. The parametric equations are:

\[
x(t) = 6t, \quad y(t) = 6 - 3t, \quad z(t) = 4 - t.
\]

The position vector is \(\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t \rangle\). The derivative is:

\[
\mathbf{r}'(t) = \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle.
\]

The magnitude of the derivative is:

\[
\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\| = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}.
\]

Since \(\|\mathbf{r}'(t)\|\) is constant, \(ds = \sqrt{46}  dt\).

The function to integrate is \(f(x, y, z) = x^3 z\). Substituting the parametric equations:

\[
f(\mathbf{r}(t)) = (6t)^3 \cdot (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4.
\]

The line integral becomes:

\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \cdot \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt.
\]

Compute the integral:

\[
\int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt = \left[ 864 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left[ 216t^4 - \frac{216}{5}t^5 \right]_0^1.
\]

Evaluate at the limits:

\[
216(1)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(1)^5 - \left( 216(0)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(0)^5 \right) = 216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{1080}{5} - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{864}{5}.
\]

Multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\):

\[
\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}.
\]

This fraction is already simplified, as 864 and 5 are coprime, and 46 has no square factors.

Thus, the value of the line integral is \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\).

\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
