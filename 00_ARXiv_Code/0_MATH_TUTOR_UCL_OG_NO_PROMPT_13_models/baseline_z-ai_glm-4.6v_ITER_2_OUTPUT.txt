=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

First, I need to parameterize the line segment C. The line segment goes from point A(0,6,4) to point B(6,3,3).

The parametric equations for a line segment from point A to point B can be written as:
r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t ∈ [0,1]

So:
r(t) = (0,6,4) + t(6,3,3) - (0,6,4)
r(t) = (0,6,4) + t(6,-3,-1)
r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)

Now I need to find the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:
r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude of r'(t) is:
|r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

Now I need to express x, y, and z in terms of t:
x = 6t
y = 6-3t  
z = 4-t

The line integral becomes:
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4-t) |r'(t)| dt
= ∫_0^1 216t³(4-t)√46 dt
= 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt

Now I'll evaluate the integral:
∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0) = 4/5

So the line integral is:
216√46 × 4/5 = 864√46/5

Let me double-check this calculation:
∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - t⁵/5]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 ✓

216√46 × 4/5 = 864√46/5 ✓

So the final answer is 864√46/5.

Wait, let me reconsider the parameterization. The line segment goes from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so:
r(t) = (1-t)(0,6,4) + t(6,3,3) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)

This is the same as what I had before, so the calculation should be correct.

Let me verify the magnitude of r'(t):
r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
|r'(t)| = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46 ✓

And the integral:
∫_0^1 (6t)³(4-t)√46 dt = ∫_0^1 216t³(4-t)√46 dt = 216√46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = 216√46 × 4/5 = 864√46/5 ✓

So the final answer is 864√46/5.
