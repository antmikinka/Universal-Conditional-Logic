=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). First, I need to parameterize the curve C. 

Since it's a line segment, I can use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The parametric equations for x, y, z would be linear functions of t. Let's find the direction vector first. The endpoints are (0,6,4) and (6,3,3), so the direction vector is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). 

So the parametric equations are:
x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t
y(t) = 6 - 3t
z(t) = 4 - t

Next, I need to compute ds, which is the magnitude of the derivative of the position vector with respect to t, multiplied by dt. The position vector r(t) is (6t, 6-3t, 4-t). The derivative r'(t) is (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [x(t)]³ * z(t) * sqrt(46) dt. Substituting x(t) and z(t):

x(t)³ = (6t)³ = 216t³
z(t) = 4 - t

So the integrand is 216t³ * (4 - t) * sqrt(46). Let's expand that: 216*(4t³ - t⁴)*sqrt(46). 

Integrate term by term:
∫0^1 216*sqrt(46)*(4t³ - t⁴) dt = 216*sqrt(46) [4*(t⁴/4) - (t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1
Simplify the antiderivative: [t⁴ - t⁵/5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5.

Multiply by 216*sqrt(46): 216 * (4/5) * sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the integration again. The integral of 4t³ is t⁴, and integral of t⁴ is t⁵/5. So 4*(t⁴/4) is t⁴, yes. Then at 1, it's 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

So the main answer should be (864/5) times the square root of 46. Now, converting to TTS format.

Main answer: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

Scratchwork steps: parameterizing the curve, computing ds, substituting into the integral, integrating, and simplifying.

Need to make sure all commas and quantities are properly labeled. Since it's a single value, main_answer type is single_value. The question type is open_ended.

Check if math_content_check is yes. Yes, it's a valid math problem.

Now, structure the JSON. Problem number isn't given, so maybe "1" as default. Problem statement is "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)."

Final answers: main_answer values as TTS string. Scratchwork should have key steps in TTS format.
