**Evaluating line integral**

I'm working on the line integral ∫_C x^3 z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). The integrand is f(x,y,z) = x^3 z, and I need to parameterize the line and compute ds. I find r(t) = (0,6,4) + t(6,-3,-1). After calculating and simplifying, I integrate to find the value. Double-check for any errors, like the final subtraction, ensuring everything adds up correctly.**Finalizing the integral calculation**

I’m confirming my calculations for the integral. So I have 216 - 216/5, which gives me 864/5. Multiplying that by √46 gets me (864/5)√46. I could approximate it to about 172.8√46, but it’s best to keep it exact. Checking my previous arithmetic, I realize the integrand is correct as well. Finally, I can provide reasoning for the steps taken, such as parameterization, computing r'(t), and finding the norm while keeping it concise.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
Parameterize the line from A=(0,6,4) to B=(6,3,3) by
r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Then r'(t) = (6, -3, -1) and |r'(t)| = sqrt(36+9+1) = sqrt(46).

The integrand is x^3 z = (6t)^3(4-t) = 216 t^3(4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4. Thus
∫_C x^3 z ds = ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46) dt
= sqrt(46) [864·(1/4) - 216·(1/5)]
= sqrt(46) · (864/5).

So the value is (864/5) sqrt(46) (≈ 1.172×10^3).
