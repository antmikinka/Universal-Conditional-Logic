I need to evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). First, I recall that for a line integral with respect to arc length, ds, I need to parametrize the curve and then express ds in terms of the parameter.

So, the curve is a straight line from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). I should find a vector equation for this line. The direction vector from the start to the end point is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So, the parametric equations would be:

Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at (0,6,4), and when t=1, we're at (6,3,3). So,

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 + (-3)t = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 + (-1)t = 4 - t

Now, I need ds, the arc length element. I know that ds = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dz}{dt} \right)^2 }  dt

So, let's compute the derivatives:

dx/dt = 6

dy/dt = -3

dz/dt = -1

So, the magnitude is \sqrt{ (6)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 } = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}

That's constant, which makes sense for a straight line. So, ds = \sqrt{46}  dt

Now, the integral is \int_C x^3 z  ds

Substituting the parametric equations:

x(t) = 6t, so x^3 = (6t)^3 = 216 t^3

z(t) = 4 - t

So, the integrand is x^3 z = 216 t^3 (4 - t)

And ds = \sqrt{46}  dt

The limits for t are from 0 to 1, since it's from start to end.

So, the integral becomes:

\int_{t=0}^{t=1} 216 t^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46}  dt

I can factor out the constants: 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 t^3 (4 - t)  dt

Now, I need to compute the integral \int_0^1 t^3 (4 - t)  dt

First, expand the integrand: t^3 (4 - t) = 4t^3 - t^4

So, \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt

Integrate term by term:

Antiderivative of 4t^3 is 4*(t^4/4) = t^4

Antiderivative of -t^4 is -t^5/5

So, \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1

At t=1: (1)^4 - (1)^5 / 5 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

At t=0: 0 - 0 = 0

So, the integral is 4/5

Now, plug back in:

216 \sqrt{46} * (4/5)

Simplify: 216 * 4 / 5 * \sqrt{46} = (864 / 5) \sqrt{46}

I could write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me check if I can simplify this fraction. 864 and 5, 5 is prime, 864 divided by 5? No, 864 / 5 is not integer, so it's fine.

I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But maybe I should see if 864 and 5 have common factors, but 5 is prime, and 864 ends with 4, not 0 or 5, so no common factors. So it's simplified.

I recall that 864 can be simplified, but since it's multiplied by sqrt(46), and 46=2*23, no squares, so it's fine.

But let me double-check my calculations.

First, parametric equations: x=6t, y=6-3t, z=4-t. That seems correct.

dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1, magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), good.

x^3 = (6t)^3 = 216 t^3, good.

z=4-t, so x^3 z = 216 t^3 (4-t), good.

ds = sqrt(46) dt, good.

Limits t=0 to t=1, good.

Integrand: 216 sqrt(46) \int_0^1 t^3 (4-t) dt = 216 sqrt(46) \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt

Integral: [t^4 - t^5/5]_0^1 = (1 - 1/5) - (0) = 4/5, good.

So, 216 * sqrt(46) * 4 / 5 = 216 * 4 / 5 * sqrt(46) = 864 / 5 * sqrt(46)

Now, 864 / 5 is 172.8, but better to leave as fraction.

I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me see if I can simplify 864 and 5, but no.

864 and the denominator 5, but since it's in numerator, and 5 is prime, it's fine.

I could write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but same thing.

Notice that 864 and 46 might have common factors, but 46 is under square root, so probably not.

46 = 2 * 23, and 864 is divisible by 2, but since it's multiplied, and no squares in denominator, it's fine.

I could factor out, but I think it's simplified.

Another way: 216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5, and 864 = 16 * 54? Or something, but no need.

I recall that 216 is 6^3, but not helpful.

So, the integral is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me confirm the constant.

216 * 4 = 864, yes.

I could compute numerically to check.

sqrt(46) ≈ 6.78233

864 / 5 = 172.8

172.8 * 6.78233 ≈ let's see, 170 * 6.78233 ≈ 170*6.78 = 1152.6, 170*0.00233≈0.3961, total ≈1152.9961

Then 2.8 * 6.78233 ≈ 2.8*6.78=18.984, 2.8*0.00233≈0.006524, total ≈18.990524

So total ≈1152.9961 + 18.990524 = 1171.986624, but that's rough.

Better: 172.8 * 6.78233

First, 172.8 * 6 = 1036.8

172.8 * 0.7 = 120.96

172.8 * 0.08 = 13.824

172.8 * 0.002 = 0.3456

172.8 * 0.0003 = 0.05184

172.8 * 0.00003 = 0.005184

Now sum: 1036.8 + 120.96 = 1157.76

+13.824 = 1171.584

+0.3456 = 1171.9296

+0.05184 ≈ 1171.98144

+0.005184 ≈ 1171.986624

Now, the integral should be around there, but I don't know the exact value, but it should be correct.

I could compute the integral without parametric.

Since it's a straight line, I can use the formula for line integrals.

But I think parametric is fine.

Another way: the line segment from A(0,6,4) to B(6,3,3).

The vector AB = (6,-3,-1)

The length of AB is sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), as before.

Now, a point on the line can be written as (1-s) A + s B, for s from 0 to 1.

When s=0, (0,6,4), s=1, (6,3,3), good.

So, x = (1-s)*0 + s*6 = 6s

y = (1-s)*6 + s*3 = 6 - 6s + 3s = 6 - 3s

z = (1-s)*4 + s*3 = 4 - 4s + 3s = 4 - s

Same as before, with s instead of t. So same thing.

Now, ds is the arc length element. The speed is |d r / ds| = |AB| = sqrt(46), since constant speed if parameterized linearly.

dr/ds = B - A = (6,-3,-1), magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), so ds = |dr/ds| ds? No.

In terms of s, the derivative with respect to s: dx/ds = 6, dy/ds = -3, dz/ds = -1, so |dr/ds| = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), and since s is proportional to arc length, ds = |dr/ds| ds, but ds here is the differential, but in the integral, when we say ds, it's the arc length, so actually, the arc length element is |dr/ds| ds, but since s is the parameter, and |dr/ds| is constant, but in this case, when we integrate with respect to s, the ds in the integral is already the differential of arc length? I'm getting confused.

Standard way: if we parameterize with s, from 0 to L, where L is the length, then ds = |dr/ds| ds, but since |dr/ds| is constant, and s goes from 0 to L, then the integral \int f ds = \int_0^L f(r(s)) |dr/ds| ds

But in this case, |dr/ds| = sqrt(46), and L = sqrt(46), so if s goes from 0 to L, but usually we set s from 0 to 1, and then ds corresponds to |dr/ds| ds, but if we let s go from 0 to 1, then the arc length element is |dr/ds| ds, and since |dr/ds| is constant, but when s goes from 0 to 1, the total arc length is \int_0^1 |dr/ds| ds = |dr/ds| * (1-0) = sqrt(46), so |dr/ds| = sqrt(46), and ds (the arc length element) = |dr/ds| ds, where ds is the differential of the parameter.

To avoid confusion, in my parametric form with t from 0 to 1, I have ds = |dr/dt| dt = sqrt(46) dt, which is correct, and I used that.

If I use s from 0 to 1, same thing, since t is just a dummy variable.

In my case, I used t from 0 to 1, and ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integrand is x^3 z = (6s)^3 (4-s) = 216 s^3 (4-s)

So integral is \int_0^1 216 s^3 (4-s) \sqrt{46} ds, same as before.

So, no issue.

Now, back to the integral: \int_0^1 (4s^3 - s^4) ds = [s^4 - s^5/5]_0^1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

Then 216 * \sqrt{46} * 4/5 = 864 \sqrt{46} / 5

Now, can I simplify this? 864 and 5 have no common factors, and 46 has no square factors, so it should be fine.

I could write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but perhaps I can reduce 864/5, but it's already simplified.

Notice that 864 = 864, and 5, but maybe I can write the constant as a fraction.

Another thought: 216 * 4 / 5 = 864 / 5, but 216 is 216, perhaps factor it.

216 = 6^3, but not helpful.

I could compute the numerical value, but I think for the answer, it's fine.

I recall that in some cases, they expect simplified radical, but here it is.

Perhaps I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}, but let me see if I made a mistake in the exponent.

x^3 = (6t)^3 = 216 t^3, yes.

z = 4 - t, so product is 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216 (4t^3 - t^4), yes.

Integral of 4t^3 - t^4 from 0 to 1: antiderivative t^4 - t^5/5, at 1: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, yes 4/5.

216 * 4/5 = 864/5, times sqrt(46).

864/5 = 172.8, but better as fraction.

I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}, or perhaps simplify by dividing numerator and denominator, but no.

Notice that 864 and 46 might have common factors, but 46 is under square root, so when multiplying, but since it's not a rational number, I can't simplify.

I could write the entire thing as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but I think it's standard to leave it as is.

Another way: since the direction vector is (6,-3,-1), and the length is sqrt(46), but I think it's fine.

I could think of the line integral as \int_C P dx + Q dy + R dz, but here it's only x^3 z ds, which is a scalar line integral, not vector, so parametric is correct.

So, I think the answer is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me write it neatly.

So, final answer is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

To make it look better, I can write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, same thing.

Or factor out, but no.

Notice that 864 = 16 * 54, but 54 and 5 no common factors, so no.

864 = 864, and 5 is prime, so fraction is simplified.

So, I think that's the answer.

But let me check the calculation of the integral again.

\int_0^1 t^3 (4 - t) dt = \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}]_0^1 = (1 - \frac{1}{5}) - 0 = \frac{4}{5}, yes.

216 * \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864}{5}

Then times \sqrt{46}, so \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Perhaps they want it as a mixed number, but no, fraction is fine.

Or I can write it as 172.8 \sqrt{46}, but that's decimal, not exact.

So, fractional form is better.

Another thought: 864 and 5, but 864 divided by 1, but no.

I recall that in the direction vector, the components are 6,-3,-1, and magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), and the integral involves x and z, which are proportional to t, so it makes sense.

I could compute the average or something, but I think it's correct.

So, I'll box the answer.

But let me see if I can simplify \sqrt{46}, but 46=2*23, no squares, so no.

So, the final answer is \dfrac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

To write it in the box.

But in the problem, it says "output the final answer within \boxed{}", so I should do that.

So, \boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}

But let me confirm the constant: 216 * 4 = 864, yes, and divided by 5, times sqrt(46).

216 * sqrt(46) * 4 / 5 = same.

I could write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but in LaTeX, it's the same.

Some might write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

I think that's standard.

So, I'll go with that.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), parametrize the curve and compute the arc length element \(ds\).

The parametric equations for the line segment, with parameter \(t\) ranging from 0 to 1, are:
- \(x(t) = 6t\)
- \(y(t) = 6 - 3t\)
- \(z(t) = 4 - t\)

The derivatives are:
- \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 6\)
- \(\frac{dy}{dt} = -3\)
- \(\frac{dz}{dt} = -1\)

The arc length element is:
\[
ds = \sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dz}{dt} \right)^2}  dt = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2}  dt = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1}  dt = \sqrt{46}  dt
\]

The integrand is:
\[
x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 216(4t^3 - t^4)
\]

The integral becomes:
\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_{t=0}^{t=1} 216(4t^3 - t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt = 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt
\]

Evaluate the integral:
\[
\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{5} \right) - (0) = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Substitute back:
\[
216 \sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{864}{5}\) is simplified, as 864 and 5 have no common factors, and \(\sqrt{46}\) cannot be simplified further since \(46 = 2 \times 23\) has no square factors.

Thus, the value of the line integral is \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\).

\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
