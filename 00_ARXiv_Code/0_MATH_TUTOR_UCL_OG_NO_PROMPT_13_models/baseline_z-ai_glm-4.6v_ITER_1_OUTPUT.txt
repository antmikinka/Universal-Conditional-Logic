=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

First, I need to parameterize the line segment C. The line segment goes from point A = (0,6,4) to point B = (6,3,3).

A parameterization of the line segment can be:
r(t) = A + t(B - A) = (0,6,4) + t(6,3,3) - (0,6,4) = (0,6,4) + t(6,-3,-1)
where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So:
r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t)

Now I need to find the derivative of r(t):
r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude of r'(t) is:
|r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

Now I need to express x³z in terms of t:
x = 6t
z = 4-t
So x³z = (6t)³(4-t) = 216t³(4-t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴

The line integral becomes:
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) |r'(t)| dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt
= √46 [216t⁴ - 54t⁵]_0^1
= √46 (216 - 54)
= √46 × 162
= 162√46

Let me double-check this calculation:
∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = [864(t⁴/4) - 216(t⁵/5)]_0^1
= [216t⁴ - 43.2t⁵]_0^1
= 216 - 43.2
= 172.8

Wait, I made an error in my calculation. Let me recalculate:

∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = [864(t⁴/4) - 216(t⁵/5)]_0^1
= [216t⁴ - 43.2t⁵]_0^1
= 216 - 43.2
= 172.8

So the integral is:
√46 × 172.8 = 172.8√46

Let me express this more precisely:
∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = [216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵]_0^1
= 216 - 216/5
= (1080 - 216)/5
= 864/5

So the integral is:
√46 × 864/5 = (864√46)/5

Let me verify this one more time:
∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = [864(t⁴/4) - 216(t⁵/5)]_0^1
= [216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵]_0^1
= 216 - 216/5
= (1080 - 216)/5
= 864/5

Yes, that's correct. So the line integral is (864√46)/5.

Now I need to format this as a JSON response according to the instructions.
