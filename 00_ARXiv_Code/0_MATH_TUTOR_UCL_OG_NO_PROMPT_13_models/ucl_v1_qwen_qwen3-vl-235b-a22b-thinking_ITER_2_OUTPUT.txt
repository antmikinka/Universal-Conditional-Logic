=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). Hmm, first I need to remember how to compute a line integral with respect to arc length. 

So, the formula for a line integral over a scalar field is ∫_C f(x, y, z) ds = ∫_a^b f(r(t)) ||r'(t)|| dt, where r(t) is the parametrization of the curve C from t=a to t=b.

First step is to parametrize the line segment. The general way to parametrize a line segment from point P to point Q is r(t) = P + t(Q - P), where t goes from 0 to 1.

Let me write down the points: P is (0, 6, 4) and Q is (6, 3, 3). So the vector from P to Q is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1).

Therefore, the parametrization should be r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t in [0,1].

Next, I need to find ds. ds is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, multiplied by dt. So let's compute r'(t).

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integrand is x³ z. Let's express x and z in terms of t using the parametrization. 

x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t. Therefore, x³ z = (6t)³ (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t).

Putting it all together, the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [216 t³ (4 - t)] * sqrt(46) dt.

Let me factor out the constants: 216 sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ t³ (4 - t) dt.

Now compute the integral inside. Let's expand t³ (4 - t) = 4t³ - t⁴.

Integrate term by term: ∫₀¹ 4t³ dt - ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt = [4*(t⁴/4)] from 0 to 1 - [t⁵/5] from 0 to 1 = [t⁴] from 0 to 1 - [t⁵/5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 0) - (1/5 - 0) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, ∫4t³ dt is 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴, evaluated from 0 to1 is 1. ∫t⁴ dt is t⁵/5, evaluated from 0 to1 is 1/5. So 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Yes, that's correct.

So the integral inside is 4/5. Then multiply by 216 sqrt(46): 216 * (4/5) * sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, let me confirm all steps again to be sure.

Parametrization: correct. From (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so direction vector is (6, -3, -1). So r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t). Correct.

r'(t) is (6, -3, -1), magnitude sqrt(36 +9 +1)=sqrt(46). Correct.

x(t)=6t, z(t)=4 - t. So x³ z = (6t)^3*(4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Correct.

Integral becomes 216 sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt. The integral of 4t³ is t⁴, which is 1 at 1, 0 at 0. Integral of t⁴ is 1/5. So 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. So total is 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = (864/5) sqrt(46). 

Yes, that seems right. So the final answer should be 864 sqrt(46) divided by 5. Let me check if there's any mistake in the parametrization or in the integral calculation.

Wait, another way to check: maybe the parametrization. If t=0, we get (0,6,4), correct. t=1, (6,3,3), correct. So that's right.

The magnitude of the derivative is correct. 6 squared is 36, (-3)^2 is 9, (-1)^2 is 1. Sum is 46, square root is sqrt(46). Correct.

The integrand substitution: x is 6t, z is 4 - t, so x³ z is (6t)^3*(4 - t). Yes. Then multiplied by ds which is sqrt(46) dt. So the integral is correct.

Integral of 4t³ - t⁴ from 0 to1: yes, 4*(1/4) - 1/5 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, 4t³ integrated is 4*(t^4 /4) = t^4, so from 0 to1 is 1. Then minus integral of t^4 is 1/5. So total 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. Correct.

So 216 * 4/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by sqrt(46). So the final answer is (864/5)√46. 

I think that's it. Let me just make sure there are no calculation errors. 216*4 is 864. Yes. So 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, but as a fraction, 864/5 is correct. So the answer is 864√46 /5.
