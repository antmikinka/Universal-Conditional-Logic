**Calculating integral expression**

I’m working out the difference and integral using the formula: \( 216 - \frac{216}{5} \), which simplifies to \( 216 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) = \frac{864}{5} \). Then, I multiply this by \( \sqrt{46} \). I need to ensure it’s in TTS-ready format, using "the quantity" for primary grouping. The final answer should follow these rules for clarity, providing a single value in natural language.**Formatting the final answer**

I can present the final answer as "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four divided by five end quantity times square root of the quantity forty-six end quantity." It’s important to use "the quantity" for grouping and "end quantity" for closures, avoiding symbols and using "divided by" instead of a slash. I’ll also follow comma rules properly. My scratchwork will focus on essential steps while ensuring the parameters and expressions are clear, using TTS-ready language for readability.**Speaking numbers clearly**

I need to express numbers as words for clarity, like saying "eight hundred sixty-four divided by five" instead of using the fraction notation. Also, coordinates should clearly state commas, so I’ll say "point zero comma six comma four" for (0, 6, 4). Numbers spoken as words include zero, six, and four. For scratchwork, I’ll keep statements succinct, like: "Parameterization r of t equals vector zero comma six comma four plus t times vector six comma negative three comma negative one for zero less than or equal to t less than or equal to one."**Clarifying equations and calculations**

I’ll express the equations clearly, like saying "x equals six t" and "z equals four minus t," while noting that y might not be needed. For the magnitude of \( r' \), I’ll say "the magnitude of r prime equals square root of the quantity thirty-six plus nine plus one end quantity equals square root of the quantity forty-six end quantity." For the integrand, I need to articulate it as "eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth," ensuring I say "t cubed" and "t to the fourth" clearly.**Preparing the integral evaluation**

I’m crafting the integral expression, where I’ll state: "Integral equals square root of the quantity forty-six end quantity times the integral from zero to one of the quantity eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth end quantity dt." I need to keep things concise, reducing steps to the essentials. I'll set up the JSON with defined fields for the problem, including the mathematical extraction and grouping rules, like using "the quantity" for all primary groupings and ensuring clarity throughout.
