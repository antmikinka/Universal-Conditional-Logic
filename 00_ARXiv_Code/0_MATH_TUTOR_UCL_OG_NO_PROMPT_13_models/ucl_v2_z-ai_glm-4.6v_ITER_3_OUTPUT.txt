=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to remember how to compute a line integral over a line segment. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I should parameterize the line segment. Let's denote the start point as P0 = (0,6,4) and the end point as P1 = (6,3,3). The parameterization of a line segment from P0 to P1 is usually r(t) = P0 + t(P1 - P0) where t goes from 0 to 1. 

So let's compute the direction vector: P1 - P0 = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Then the parameterization is r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) for t ∈ [0,1]. 

Next, we need to find ds, which is the arc length element. ds = ||r'(t)|| dt. Let's compute r'(t): the derivative of r(t) with respect to t is (6, -3, -1). The magnitude of r'(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, we need to express x, y, z in terms of t. From the parameterization: x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t. 

Substitute these into the integrand: x³z = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216t³ * (4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴.

Now the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt. We can factor out sqrt(46) since it's a constant: sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt.

Let's compute the integral of 864t³: 864 * (t⁴/4) = 216t⁴. The integral of -216t⁴: -216 * (t⁵/5) = -216t⁵/5. Evaluate from 0 to 1: [216(1)⁴ - 216(1)⁵/5] - [0 - 0] = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5.

Then multiply by sqrt(46): (864/5) * sqrt(46). Let's check if that can be simplified. 864 and 5 have no common factors, so that's the result. Wait, let me verify the steps again.

Wait, parameterization: r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t). Correct. r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). Magnitude: sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). Correct. ds = sqrt(46) dt. Correct. x = 6t, so x³ = 216t³. z = 4 - t. So x³z = 216t³(4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴. Correct. Integral from 0 to 1: ∫(864t³ - 216t⁴) dt = 864*(t⁴/4) - 216*(t⁵/5) = 216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵. Evaluated at 1: 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by sqrt(46): (864/5)sqrt(46). That seems right. Let me check if I made a mistake in the direction vector or parameterization. The start point is (0,6,4), end is (6,3,3). So the change in x is 6, y is -3, z is -1. Correct. So parameterization is correct. The integral steps look good. So the final answer should be (864/5) times the square root of 46.
