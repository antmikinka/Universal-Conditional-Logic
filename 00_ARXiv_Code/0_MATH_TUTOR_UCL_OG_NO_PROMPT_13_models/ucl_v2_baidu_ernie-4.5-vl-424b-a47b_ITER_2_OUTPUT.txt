We are given a line integral: ∫_C x^3 z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 Steps:
 1. Parameterize the line segment C.
    Let t be a parameter such that t=0 at (0,6,4) and t=1 at (6,3,3).
    Then:
        x(t) = 0 + (6-0)t = 6t
        y(t) = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t
        z(t) = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

 2. Compute the differential arc length ds.
    ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt
    dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1
    So, ds = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) dt = sqrt(36+9+1) dt = sqrt(46) dt

 3. Write the integral in terms of t:
    x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

    Therefore, the integral becomes:
        ∫_(t=0 to 1) (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) * sqrt(46) dt

 4. Factor out sqrt(46):
        sqrt(46) * ∫_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt

 5. Compute the integral:
        = sqrt(46) * [ 864 * (t^4/4) - 216 * (t^5/5) ] from 0 to 1
        = sqrt(46) * [ 864/4 - 216/5 ]
        = sqrt(46) * [ 216 - 43.2 ]
        = sqrt(46) * (172.8)

 6. Simplify:
        172.8 = 1728/10 = 864/5
        So, = sqrt(46) * (864/5)

    Alternatively, we can write 172.8 as a fraction: 172.8 = 1728/10 = 864/5.

    Therefore: 
        = (864/5) * sqrt(46)

 7. We can leave it in this form or compute a decimal. However, the problem might expect an exact answer.

 But note: let me check the computation of the integral step again.

    ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1
        = [ 864 * (t^4/4) - 216 * (t^5/5) ] from 0 to 1
        = 216 * t^4 - (216/5) * t^5   [evaluated at 1] 
        = 216 - 216/5 
        = (1080 - 216)/5 
        = 864/5

    So, indeed: 864/5 * sqrt(46)

 However, note that 864/5 is 172.8, so the answer is 172.8 * sqrt(46). 
 But we can also write it as (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 Let me check if we can simplify 864 and 5? They are co-prime? 864 is divisible by 2,5? 864/5 is already in simplest fractional form.

 Alternatively, we can factor 864: 864 = 144 * 6, but that doesn't help with the denominator 5.

 Therefore, the exact answer is (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 We can also write it as (864/5) * sqrt(46).

 But note: 864/5 is 172.8, so if we want a decimal we can compute:
        172.8 * sqrt(46) ≈ 172.8 * 6.782329983 ≈ 1172.00 (approximately) but the problem does not specify.

 However, the instruction says to output in natural spoken language. But note that the overall structure is to output a JSON.

 But wait: the system is set to convert mathematical expressions to natural spoken language. However, the final answer we are to put in the JSON is the TTS-ready string.

 However, the problem is: we are to output the entire structure? The system description is complex. But for this problem, we are to compute the integral and then represent the answer in the JSON.

 But note the extraction_and_conversion_protocol: 
    We are to extract the problem text and convert to TTS natural language. However, the problem text is already given in text.

 However, we are also to extract the answer and convert to TTS.

 Steps for our answer:

 We have the answer: (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5

 How to convert this to spoken language?
    Using the transformation rules:
        exponent: "to the power of" is not directly here, but square root is handled by: "square root of 46"
        fraction: "864 over 5 times square root of 46" OR we can say "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six"

 But note: we can also simplify the fraction? It's already in simplest terms.

 Alternatively, we can write it as a decimal? But the problem doesn't specify.

 However, the instruction says: "preserving mathematical accuracy", so we should keep the exact form.

 Therefore, we can represent the answer as:
    "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six"

 But note: the entire expression is a product? Yes: 864/5 * sqrt(46)

 Alternatively, we can say: "the fraction with numerator eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six and denominator five"

 But the transformation rule for fraction: 
        fraction_format: "{{numerator:number_value}} over {{denominator:number_value}}"

    However, here we have a product of a fraction and a square root. So we can break it down:

        We can say: "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four divided by five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 But the system might break down the expression by nesting? Since this is an arithmetic expression.

 Alternatively, we can use the rule for function notation? But it's not a function.

 The transformation rule for exponent is not applicable. We have a fraction and a square root.

 How about: 
        "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

 But note: the multiplication is implied? We need to be clear.

 Since the system's transformation rules do not explicitly cover products of fractions and roots, we must use the general expression:

    We can use: "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six, all divided by five"

 However, the rules do not specify a general arithmetic expression. But note that in the <tts_transformation_rules> we have rules for fractions, roots, etc.

 The instruction says: "covering complete mathematical notation", but we are to break down by the structure.

 Alternatively, we can think of it as:

        (864 / 5) * sqrt(46) 

    We can say: 
        "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four over five, multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 This is acceptable.

 But note: the system might break the expression into parts due to the processing_framework and the nesting conditions. However, for a simple expression like this, we can represent it as:

        "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

 However, to avoid ambiguity, we can use "multiplied by".

 Let me see the transformation rule for function notation? It doesn't fit. We don't have a function name.

 Alternatively, we can use the general rule: 
        [[TRANSFORM: ... ]] for the entire expression? The system might not have a specific rule for this combination.

 But note: the system says to preserve mathematical accuracy. So we have to represent it without symbols.

 We can break it down using the rules:

        First, the fraction: "eight hundred sixty-four over five"
        Then the square root: "square root of forty-six"
        Then the multiplication: we don't have a rule for multiplication explicit, but we have the separator_vocalization: explicit_comma_statement for list_based_notation? This is not a list.

 However, note that the expression has two factors. We can use the word "times" or "multiplied by".

 In the absence of a specific rule, we can use the natural language.

 Therefore, we will represent the answer as:

        "eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 But note: the multiplication symbol is not converted by a specific rule? We have to choose a word. The system rules do not specify. However, in natural spoken language, we use "times" or "multiplied by".

 Alternatively, we can use the rule for exponent? No.

 Since the system is designed to convert expressions, and we have a fraction and a root, we can combine them as above.

 However, note the rule for negative_number, decimal, fraction, exponent, square_root, vector, function. We are using fraction and square_root, and then we are combining with multiplication. The multiplication is not explicitly covered. But we can use the word "times" as it is natural.

 But wait: the transformation for fraction: "numerator over denominator", and for square root: "square root of ...". Then we can say "times" for multiplication.

 This should be acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can use the rule for function notation? No, because it's not a function.

 Therefore, the TTS representation for the answer is:

        "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

 But to be more precise, we can say:

        "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 However, the system might break it down as a list? We are not using a list. We are using a product of two terms.

 But note the processing_framework: if the nesting_depth is level_1, then we say "the quantity ...". But here we have two factors? Actually, the entire expression is a product. We can consider it as a single expression? 

 The entire expression: (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5 can be seen as a fraction with numerator 864 * sqrt(46) and denominator 5. Then we can represent it as:

        "the fraction with numerator the quantity eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six and denominator five"

 But that is more complex. And we have a rule for fraction: "numerator over denominator". However, the numerator is a product. So we break the numerator? 

 We can break the expression:

        Step 1: Represent the fraction as a whole: 
            "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six all over five"

        But that is natural.

 Therefore, we can use:

        "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

 However, note that without parentheses, this might be ambiguous? But in natural language, we use the order of the words: we say "eight hundred sixty-four times ... over five", meaning the product is the numerator.

 Alternatively, we can say:

        "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six, all divided by five"

 This is clear.

 But the system rules do not specify how to handle such expressions. However, the goal is to be accurate and natural.

 We'll choose: "eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six, all over five"

 However, note the transformation rule for fraction: we are representing the entire expression as a fraction? But the numerator is an expression. So:

        numerator: the product of 864 and sqrt(46) -> represented as "eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six"
        denominator: 5

        Then, using the fraction rule: "numerator over denominator" -> "eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six over five"

        But to avoid ambiguity, we can use the word "all" to group the numerator: "all over five"

        Alternatively: "eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by the square root of forty-six, all over five"

 Since the system might break the numerator due to the multiplication? We can treat the product as a level_2 expression? Then we say "inside that quantity" for the product? But that would be:

        "the fraction with numerator the quantity [inside that quantity eight hundred sixty-four multiplied by [inside that quantity the square root of forty-six]] ..." -> too nested.

 Alternatively, we can represent the entire expression as a level_1 expression: "the quantity ...", where ... is the entire numerator expression and then the division.

 But that is not directly covered. We are breaking the expression into a fraction, and the numerator is a product. The system might handle the product in the numerator as a level_1 expression? Then we say for the numerator: "the quantity ...", but then the denominator is 5.

 So the entire fraction becomes: "the quantity of ... over five"? That might be acceptable.

 However, after consideration, I think the most natural and clear way is:

        "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

 But note that without grouping, the division might be associated with the square root? But in natural language, we associate the division with the entire product because of the order.

 Alternatively, we can use:

        "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 However, that changes the order: it becomes (864/5) * sqrt(46) which is the same. But then we have two terms: (fraction) and (square root). We can use the word "times" in between.

 Since the order of factors doesn't matter, we can do that.

 But note: the original expression was 864 * sqrt(46) / 5, which is the same as (864/5) * sqrt(46). So both are equivalent.

 Therefore, we can represent it as:

        "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 This is two factors.

 Now, for the JSON output, we have:

        "main_answer": {
            "type": "single_value",
            "values": [ "eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six" ]
        }

 But note: the answer type we set in the processing_framework: for an exact answer, we set "single_value". This is a single expression.

 Alternatively, we can represent the answer as a single fraction if we rationalize? But that would be more complex and we have a square root in the numerator. So we leave as is.

 However, let me compute the numerical value to check?

        sqrt(46) ≈ 6.782329983
        864 * 6.782329983 ≈ 5860.992 (then divided by 5) -> 1172.1984

        But note: our algebraic result was 864/5 * sqrt(46) = 172.8 * 6.782329983 ≈ 1172.1984

        Alternatively, we can write the answer as a decimal? But the problem does not specify. However, the exact form is better.

 Therefore, we stick with the exact form.

 Now, note the scratchwork_answer: the steps of calculation.

 We have to convert the entire calculation to TTS as well? The system says to convert the problem text and the answer, and if provided the scratchwork. But in this case, we are to show the scratchwork? The problem didn't provide an answer, so we populate the scratchwork.

 Steps for scratchwork:

    We parameterized the line segment: 
        "Let t be a parameter from zero to one. Then, x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t."

    Then, "The differential element d s is calculated as the square root of the quantity six squared plus negative three squared plus negative one squared, all times d t. That is the square root of forty-six d t."

    Then, "The integrand is x cubed times z, which is six t cubed times four minus t, which is two hundred sixteen t cubed times four minus t? Wait, no: (6t)^3 = 216 t^3, then times (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4."

    Then, "The integral becomes the integral from zero to one of the quantity eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth, all times the square root of forty-six d t."

    Then, "Factor out the square root of forty-six: the square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth d t."

    Then, "Compute the integral: the antiderivative is eight hundred sixty-four times t to the fourth over four, which is two hundred sixteen t to the fourth, minus two hundred sixteen times t to the fifth over five, which is two hundred sixteen over five t to the fifth."

    Then, "Evaluate at one: two hundred sixteen minus two hundred sixteen over five."

        "Two hundred sixteen is equal to ten eighty over five, so ten eighty over five minus two hundred sixteen over five = eight hundred sixty-four over five."

    Then, "Multiply by the square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six."

 This is a lot of steps. We need to convert each step to natural spoken language.

 However, note the system: we are to break the calculation steps and convert each to TTS. We can have multiple values in "scratchwork_answer.values".

 But note the population_directives: 
        [[ENSURE: scratchwork_answer.values contains step-by-step reasoning in TTS format]]

        And if there are multiple blanks, we have to reference by blank number? But here we don't have blanks.

 Therefore, we can have an array of strings for the scratchwork.

 Steps in TTS:

    step1: "Parameterize the line segment using t from zero to one: x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, and z equals four minus t."
    step2: "Compute the differential arc length: d s equals the square root of the sum of the squares of the derivatives: six squared is thirty-six, negative three squared is nine, negative one squared is one, sum is forty-six, so d s equals square root of forty-six d t."
    step3: "Express the integrand: x cubed z equals (six t) cubed times (four minus t) equals two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t) equals eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth."
    step4: "The integral becomes: integral from zero to one of (eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth) times square root of forty-six d t."
    step5: "Factor out square root of forty-six: square root of forty-six times integral from zero to one of (eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth) d t."
    step6: "Compute the integral: the antiderivative is eight hundred sixty-four times t to the fourth over four, which is two hundred sixteen t to the fourth, minus two hundred sixteen times t to the fifth over five, which is two hundred sixteen over five t to the fifth."
    step7: "Evaluate at one: two hundred sixteen minus two hundred sixteen over five. Convert two hundred sixteen to fraction over five: two hundred sixteen is one thousand eighty over five, so one thousand eighty over five minus two hundred sixteen over five equals eight hundred sixty-four over five."
    step8: "Multiply by square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six."

 But note: step3 and step4 might be combined? We can also simplify step7: 216 = 216 * 5 / 5 = 1080/5, then 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5.

 Now, for the JSON, we have to output the entire structure.

 However, note the problem_statement: we have to convert the given problem text to natural spoken language without mathematical symbols.

 The given problem text: 
        "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x^3 z ds Where: C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

 We convert:
        "Evaluate the line integral: the integral over C of x cubed times z d s, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

 But we must remove all mathematical symbols. We have:
        ∫ -> "the integral over"
        C: we can say "along the curve C" or "over C", but then we define C.
        Alternatively: "the integral of x cubed z ds along the line segment C, which runs from the point (0,6,4) to the point (6,3,3)."

        However, the system transformation rules cover specific notations. We have:

            integral: we don't have a direct rule? But the system will break down the entire expression. However, the rule for function notation: 
                "function {{function_name}} of {{parameters}}" 
                But here the function is the integrand? And we have the integral sign.

            Alternatively, we can represent the integral as:

                "the integral over C of the quantity x cubed times z with respect to arc length s"

            And then define C.

        But we are to convert the entire problem statement? We can break it:

            "Evaluate the line integral" -> "Evaluate the line integral"

            Then the expression: we can use the rules for exponent, product, etc.

        However, the system might process the entire expression? But we are to convert to natural language without symbols.

        We can do:

            "Evaluate the line integral of the function x cubed times z with respect to arc length along the curve C, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

        But the symbols (0,6,4) etc. are mathematical as well? We have to convert the points.

        For a point (0,6,4): we can say "the point with coordinates zero, six, four".

        Similarly, (6,3,3): "the point with coordinates six, three, three".

        Then the entire problem statement:

            "Evaluate the line integral of the function x cubed times z with respect to arc length along the curve C, where C is the line segment from the point with coordinates zero, six, four to the point with coordinates six, three, three."

        However, the system might break down the integral expression? We don't have a rule for integral. But note the transformation rules do not cover the integral sign? 

        The <tts_transformation_rules> includes:
            [[TRANSFORM: ... integral_format ... ]] in the linear algebra and multiple integrals cases? But note the multiple_integrals case: 
                [[TRANSFORM: ... integral_notation ... ]]

            But here it is a line integral. However, we have a rule for function notation? We can use that for the integrand? 

            We can represent the integrand as a function? The line integral: ∫_C f ds, and f is the function x^3 * z.

            So: "the integral along C of the function f(x,y,z) = x cubed z with respect to arc length s"

            But the problem uses x and z? We can leave as x and z, or we can say "the function of x and z given by x cubed times z".

        Alternatively, without naming the function, we can say: "the product of x cubed and z".

        And for the integral: "the integral with respect to arc length s along the path C".

        We don't have a rule for the integral sign? We have to use natural language: "the integral over C of ... ds".

        So the entire expression: "the integral over C of the product of x cubed and z with respect to arc length s"

        Then the whole problem: 
            "Evaluate the line integral: the integral over C of the product of x cubed and z with respect to arc length s, where C is the line segment from the point with coordinates 0, 6, 4 to the point with coordinates 6, 3, 3."

        This is acceptable.

 But note: the system might break down the expression using the rules? However, the rules do not cover the integral sign. We are to use natural language.

 Therefore, we will use the above.

 Now, we write the JSON.

 Steps:

    problem_number: we don't have one? But the JSON template requires "problem_number". We can leave as null or omit? The template has it.

        Since we don't have a problem number, we might set it to "1" or leave as empty? But the template expects a string. We can set to an empty string or a placeholder. However, the original problem didn't have a number.

        Alternatively, we can extract the problem number? The text says "Evaluate the line integral", no number. So we can set to "unspecified".

    Alternatively, we can omit? But the template has it. We must include.

    Let's set: "problem_number": "1"

    problem_statement: the converted natural language string we made.

    question_type: the type of question. We are to determine from the processing_framework. The question is a free response? But in the question_type switch, we have cases for multiple choice, fill in blanks, etc.

        This is a free response. In the default case, we set answer_type to "single_value". And we did.

        So "question_type": "free_response" or what? The processing_framework default sets to "single_value" for the answer type, but the question type we set in the switch? The switch has cases for multiple choice, fill in blanks, vector calculus, linear algebra, multiple integrals, applied physics, and default.

        This is a line integral -> multiple_integrals case? But note the multiple_integrals case sets answer_type to "single_value", and then we are in that case? But we also have a vector calculus case? However, line integrals are part of vector calculus? But the processing_framework has a case for vector_calculus and also multiple_integrals? 

        How do we classify? The problem is a line integral. In the switch, we have:

            ^^CASE: {{concept:multiple_integrals:mathematical_domain}}^^
                [[REQUIRE: ... ]]
                [[SET: answer_type = "single_value"]]
            ^^CASE: {{concept:vector_calculus:mathematical_domain}}^^
                ... same answer_type.

        But note: the processing_framework first activates domain_specialization if math_content_check is yes. Then we classify the question.

        However, the line integral is both multiple_integral (because it's an integral) and vector calculus? But the multiple_integrals case is for "multiple integrals" (double, triple) and the vector_calculus case is for vector calculus.

        The problem does not involve vectors explicitly? The integrand is scalar: x^3 z, and the differential is ds (arc length). So it's a scalar line integral.

        It falls under vector calculus? Because line integrals are part of vector calculus. But the multiple_integrals case says "mathematical_domain" of multiple_integrals. Line integrals are not typically multiple integrals? Multiple integrals are over 2D or 3D regions.

        Therefore, we should classify as vector_calculus? But the processing_framework has:

            [[SWITCH: question_type]]

            and then cases: multiple_choice_square, multiple_choice_circle, multiple_selection, fill_in_blanks, vector_calculus, linear_algebra, multiple_integrals, applied_physics, default.

        The question_type is set by the problem. The problem doesn't specify a type? We have to classify by the content.

        We have a line integral. We can set the question_type as "vector_calculus". Why?

            - The multiple_integrals case is for multiple integrals (double, triple) that are not necessarily vector calculus? But line integrals are a different kind.

            - However, the vector_calculus case has:

                    [[REQUIRE: vector_notation, partial_derivative_notation, curl_divergence_notation]]

                But our problem doesn't have vectors? Actually, the line integral is of a scalar field? But it's still vector calculus. However, the requirements in that case are for vector operations. We don't have curl or divergence.

            Alternatively, we can use the multiple_integrals case? But line integrals are not multiple integrals in the usual sense.

            We can also note that the answer is a scalar (single_value). The multiple_integrals case sets the answer_type to "single_value", and doesn't require any vector notation. So it might be acceptable.

            The vector_calculus case requires: partial_derivative_notation, curl_divergence_notation, etc. We don't have any of these.

            Therefore, we should use the multiple_integrals case? Or the default? 

            The multiple_integrals case says "mathematical_domain: multiple_integrals", and then requires bounds_notation. We have to specify the bounds? Our integral is over a curve, not an area or volume. But we have the bounds for the parameter t: from 0 to 1.

            However, the case multiple_integrals does not specify the type of multiple integral? It says "multiple_integrals: mathematical_domain", but line integrals are not multiple integrals.

            Therefore, I think we should use the default? But the default sets answer_type to "single_value", which is what we want.

            Alternatively, the system might have a separate case for line integrals? We don't.

            After re-examining the processing_framework:

                The vector_calculus case: 
                    [[CASE: {{concept:vector_calculus:mathematical_domain}}^^
                    ... then sets answer_type based on result_type: scalar or vector.

                We can treat this as vector calculus? The line integral of a scalar field is a scalar. So we can say:

                    result_type = "scalar"

                Then set answer_type = "single_value"

                So we can use the vector_calculus case? But then we require the notation for vector calculus: vector_notation, partial_derivative_notation, etc. We don't have vectors in the problem? 

                The integrand is a scalar, but the path is in 3D. We don't have vector fields? The differential element ds is scalar.

                However, the vector_calculus case requires:

                    [[REQUIRE: vector_notation:mathematical_representation]]

                    [[REQUIRE: partial_derivative_notation:calculus_syntax]]   ... we have derivatives (in the parameterization) but not partial derivatives? The partial derivatives are in the definition of the curve? But the vector_calculus case might be too heavy.

            Alternatively, we can use the multiple_integrals case? It requires:

                    [[REQUIRE: bounds_notation:integration_limits]]

                We do have limits: from 0 to 1 for t, and also the curve from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). But the multiple_integrals case might expect bounds for multiple variables? 

            Given the ambiguity, and since the answer is a scalar, we can use the default? The default sets answer_type to "single_value", which is what we want.

            But note: the processing_framework default:

                ^^DEFAULT:^^
                    [[APPLY: minimal_tracking:efficiency_principle]]
                    [[SET: answer_type:classification = "single_value"]]
                ^^/DEFAULT:^^

            This is acceptable.

        However, the problem is mathematical and we have already activated domain_specialization. We don't have a case that exactly fits, so we use the default.

        So "question_type": "default" or what? The question_type for the default case is not explicitly named? The default case does not set a type string? It only sets answer_type.

        In the JSON, we require a string for "question_type". We haven't set a value in the default case? We must set it.

        Looking at the framework, the default case does not have a case name? We have to choose a name. We can set it to "default".

        Alternatively, we can note that it's a free response with a single value? We can set to "free_response". But the framework cases are not named in the JSON field. The JSON field "question_type" is set from the classification.

        In the processing_framework, we set:

            [[SET: {{concept:answer_type:classification}} = ... ]]

        and for the default case, we set classification to "single_value", but we don't set a question_type string? 

        Actually, the framework does not set a question_type string. The question_type in the JSON is the overall type of the question? We haven't been told how to determine that. But the framework sets the answer_type based on the case, but the question_type for the JSON is not set by the framework? 

        Let me read the framework:

            [[SWITCH: question_type]]

            and then cases. But the cases are for the type of the answer format? Or the type of the question? The cases are named: multiple_choice_square, multiple_choice_circle, etc. These are answer formats.

            The JSON field "question_type" might be the same as the case name? 

            For example, if it's multiple_choice_square, then we set "question_type": "multiple_choice_square".

            In the default case, we do nothing? Then we haven't set the question_type? 

        How do we set it? We must set it to a string. The framework doesn't set it in the default case.

        We can set it to "free_response" or "default". But the framework has a case for "fill_in_blanks", etc. We don't have a case for free response? 

        Alternatively, the default case sets the answer_type to "single_value", but doesn't set the question_type. So for the JSON, we need to set the question_type separately.

        We can set:

            "question_type": "free_response"

        Since it's not multiple choice, not fill in blanks, etc.

    Therefore, we will set:

        "question_type": "free_response"

    math_content_check: "yes"

    final_answers: we have the main_answer and scratchwork_answer.

        main_answer: {
            "type": "single_value",
            "values": [ "eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six" ]   # or we can use the alternative representation we discussed later: "the fraction ...", but we decided on this.
        }

        scratchwork_answer: an array of strings, the steps.

    We'll write the scratchwork in an array.

    However, note: the system might break the expression in the scratchwork using the same conversion rules? We are to convert each step to TTS. For example, in step3 we have "864 t^4", we convert to "eight hundred sixty-four t to the fourth".

    We'll do that for every step.

    Finally, the JSON structure.

 Let me write the JSON accordingly.
