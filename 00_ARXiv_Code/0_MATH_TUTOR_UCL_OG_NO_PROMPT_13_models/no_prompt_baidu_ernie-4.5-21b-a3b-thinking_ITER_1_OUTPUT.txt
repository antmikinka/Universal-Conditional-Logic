=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). First, recall that for a line integral with respect to arc length, ds, I need to parametrize the curve and then express ds in terms of the parameter.

The curve is a straight line segment from point A(0,6,4) to point B(6,3,3). I should find a vector equation for this line. The direction vector from A to B is B - A = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1).

So, a parametrization of the line can be written as:

\[ \vec{r}(t) = \langle 0, 6, 4 \rangle + t \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle \]

for t from 0 to 1. When t=0, I'm at A, and when t=1, I'm at B. That makes sense.

So,

\[ x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t \]

\[ y(t) = 6 + (-3)t = 6 - 3t \]

\[ z(t) = 4 + (-1)t = 4 - t \]

Now, I need to find ds, the arc length element. ds is given by \(\sqrt{ \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dz}{dt} \right)^2 }  dt\).

So, let's compute the derivatives:

\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = 6 \]

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = -3 \]

\[ \frac{dz}{dt} = -1 \]

Now, the magnitude of the velocity vector:

\[ \sqrt{ (6)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 } = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46} \]

So, ds = \(\sqrt{46}  dt\).

Now, the integral is \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\). Substituting the parametric equations:

x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t

So, x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 * 4 - 216 t^3 * t = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

Let me compute that again.

(6t)^3 = 216 t^3, yes.

Then 216 t^3 * (4 - t) = 216 t^3 * 4 - 216 t^3 * t = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.

Yes.

Now, ds = \(\sqrt{46}  dt\), so the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{t=0}^{t=1} (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt \]

I can factor out the constant \(\sqrt{46}\):

\[ \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4)  dt \]

Now, I can integrate term by term. First, find the antiderivative.

The antiderivative of 864 t^3 is 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4

864 / 4 = 216, yes.

Antiderivative of -216 t^4 is -216 * (t^5 / 5) = -43.2 t^5, but better to keep fractions.

-216 / 5 t^5.

So, antiderivative is:

\[ 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 \]

Let me write it as:

\[ \int (864 t^3 - 216 t^4)  dt = 864 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} + C = 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 + C \]

Now, evaluate from 0 to 1.

At t=1: 216*(1)^4 - (216/5)*(1)^5 = 216 - 216/5

At t=0: 0

So, the definite integral is 216 - 216/5 = 216(1 - 1/5) = 216 * (4/5) = (216 * 4) / 5 = 864 / 5

216 * 4 = 864, yes, so 864 / 5.

But this is without the \(\sqrt{46}\) yet.

So, the integral inside is 864 / 5.

Now, multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\):

\[ \sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5} \]

I can simplify this. First, note that 864 and 5 have no common factors, but I can write it as:

\[ \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} \]

But maybe I can simplify 864 and 46. 46 is 2*23, and 864 is divisible by 2, but since it's under square root, better to see if anything simplifies.

864 divided by 2 is 432, but 46 is 2*23, so:

\[ \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} \]

But perhaps I can factor 864. 864 = 864, let me see if it has square factors.

864 divided by 16 is 54, since 16*54=864? 16*50=800, 16*4=64, total 864, yes. But 54 is not square. 864 = 144 * 6, since 144*6=864.

144 is 12^2, so:

864 = 144 * 6, so \(\sqrt{864} = \sqrt{144 \times 6} = 12 \sqrt{6}\), but here it's not under square root; it's multiplied by \(\sqrt{46}\), so it's \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\).

But 864 and 46 might have common factors, but 46 is 2*23, and 864 is divisible by 2, so:

\[ \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} \]

But 864 / 2 = 432, and 46 / 2 = 23, but since it's under square root, when I write \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\), I can write it as \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\), but perhaps simplify the fraction.

Note that 864 and 5 are coprime, since 5 is prime and doesn't divide 864 (864 ends with 4, not 0 or 5). So, the fraction is already simplified, but I can write it as:

\[ \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} \]

But earlier I have \(\sqrt{46}\) times the integral, and the integral was 864/5, so yes.

But let me double-check the integral value.

I have the integral of (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1.

I computed antiderivative as 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5.

At t=1: 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5, yes.

But is this correct? Let me compute numerically.

Integral of 864 t^3 is 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4, at 1 is 216.

Integral of -216 t^4 is -216 * (t^5 / 5) = -43.2 t^5, at 1 is -43.2.

So 216 - 43.2 = 172.8, and 864 / 5 = 172.8, yes.

Now, multiplied by \(\sqrt{46}\), so \(\sqrt{46} \times 172.8\).

But better to keep exact.

So, \(\sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5}\)

Now, 864 and 46, as I said, 46=2*23, 864=2^5 * 3^3, since 864 ÷ 2=432, ÷2=216, ÷2=108, ÷2=54, ÷2=27, ÷3=9, ÷3=3, ÷3=1, so 2^5 * 3^3.

So, no common factors with 46 except the 2, but since it's in numerator and denominator separately, I can write:

\[ \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{2^5 \cdot 3^3 \sqrt{46}}{5} \]

But perhaps simplify by factoring out the 2.

Notice that in the expression, I have \(\sqrt{46}\) and 864, but 864 has a factor of 2, but since 46 also has a 2, but when I take square root, it's not helping.

I could write it as \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\), but maybe I can compute the numerical value later if needed, but I think for the answer, it's fine.

But let me see if I made a mistake. The integral is \(\int (x^3 z) ds\), and I have x=6t, z=4-t, so x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, that's correct.

ds = \sqrt{ (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 } dt = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} dt = \sqrt{36+9+1} = \sqrt{46} dt, correct.

Limits t=0 to t=1.

Now, the integral is \(\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt\)

I can factor out 216 from the parentheses. 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 (4 t^3 - t^4)

864 / 216 = 4, yes, so 216 (4 t^3 - t^4)

So, integral is \(\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 (4 t^3 - t^4) dt = 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4 t^3 - t^4) dt\)

Now, integrate 4 t^3 - t^4.

Antiderivative: 4*(t^4/4) - t^5/5 = t^4 - \frac{1}{5} t^5

At t=1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

At t=0: 0

So integral is 4/5.

Then, 216 \sqrt{46} * (4/5) = 216 * 4 / 5 * \sqrt{46} = 864 / 5 \sqrt{46}

Same as before.

Now, 864 / 5 is 172.8, but I can leave it as fraction.

Notice that 864 and 5 are coprime, so \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

But perhaps I can write it as \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\), but I think it's acceptable.

I recall that sometimes we can simplify by factoring, but here no simplification possible.

Another thought: is the direction vector correct? When t from 0 to 1, at t=0, (0,6,4), t=1, (6,3,3), yes.

I could parametrize differently, but it should be the same.

I could use a different parameter, but it won't change the value.

Now, the answer should be \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

But let me confirm the calculation of the integral.

\(\int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = [ 864 \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \frac{t^5}{5} ]_0^1 = [216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5]_0^1 = 216(1) - \frac{216}{5}(1) = 216(1 - 0.2) = 216 * 0.8 = 172.8\)

216 * 0.8 = 172.8, and 864 / 5 = 172.8, yes.

Now multiplied by \(\sqrt{46}\), so \(\sqrt{46} \times 172.8\)

But for exact value, \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

I can write it as \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\), but same thing.

Notice that 864 and 46 have a common factor of 2.

864 = 2 * 432, 46 = 2 * 23, so:

\[ \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{2 \times 432 \times \sqrt{2 \times 23}}{5} = \frac{2 \times 432 \times \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{23}}{5} \]

But that seems messier. I could write it as \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\), or simplify by dividing numerator and denominator, but denominator is 5, numerator has no 5, so no.

Another way: \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

I think it's fine.

But let me check if I can reduce 864 and 46 by gcd, but since it's under square root, not directly.

Note that \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\), and since 864 and 5 are coprime, and 46 is square-free, this is simplified.

So the final answer should be \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

But earlier I had 216 * 4 / 5 * \sqrt{46} = 864 / 5 \sqrt{46}, same.

I could write it as \( \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} \)

Now, to box it.

But let me see if I made a mistake in the beginning.

The integral is \(\int_C x^3 z ds\), and C is line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

Parametrization: r(t) = (1-t) A + t B, or as I did, r(t) = A + t (B-A)

When t=0, A, t=1, B, yes.

x(t) = 0 + t*6 = 6t

y(t) = 6 + t*(-3) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 + t*(-1) = 4 - t

dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1

speed = sqrt( (6)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46), correct.

x^3 z = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, correct.

Integral from 0 to 1 of that times ds/dt dt, so times sqrt(46) dt.

So ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46) dt from 0 to 1.

Factor sqrt(46) ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1.

∫ 864 t^3 dt = 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4

∫ -216 t^4 dt = -216 * (t^5 / 5) = -43.2 t^5, but fraction -216/5 t^5

So [216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5] from 0 to 1 = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5

Then times sqrt(46), so sqrt(46) * 864 / 5

Yes.

I could write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

To make it look nicer, but I think it's fine.

Notice that 864 / 5 is 172.8, but better to keep fractional.

Another thought: I can factor out 216, but same thing.

Or compute the constant: 216 * sqrt(46) * (4/5) as I did earlier, since the integral of (4t^3 - t^4) dt is 4/5.

∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = t^4 - t^5/5, at 1 is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

Then 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = 864 sqrt(46) / 5, same.

So, I think it's correct.

So the final answer is \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

But let me write it properly.

Sometimes they write it as a single fraction.

I can simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by gcd, but no common factors.

Note that 864 and 5 have no common factors, and 46 is integer, so yes.

So, I'll box that.

But in the problem, it says "output the final answer within \boxed{}", so I should write it.

But let me confirm the units or something, but it's a scalar, so fine.

I could compute numerically to verify.

sqrt(46) ≈ 6.782329983

864 / 5 = 172.8

172.8 * 6.782329983 ≈ let's see, 170 * 6.782 ≈ 170*6.7 = 1139, 170*0.082=13.94, total ≈1152.94

Better: 172.8 * 6.78233

First, 172.8 * 6 = 1036.8

172.8 * 0.7 = 120.96

172.8 * 0.08 = 13.824

172.8 * 0.002 = 0.3456

172.8 * 0.0003 = 0.05184

172.8 * 0.00003 ≈ 0.005184

Now sum: 1036.8 + 120.96 = 1157.76

+13.824 = 1171.584

+0.3456 ≈ 1171.9296

+0.05184 ≈ 1171.98144

+0.005184 ≈ 1171.986624

Now, what should it be? The integral should be around there.

I could compute the integral numerically.

The function is x^3 z ds, but since ds is constant in magnitude but depends on parameter, but in parametric form.

The integrand is f(t) = (6t)^3 (4-t) * sqrt(46) = 216 t^3 (4-t) sqrt(46)

At t=0, f(0)=0

t=1, f(1)=216*1*3*sqrt(46)=648 sqrt(46)≈648*6.782≈4396. something? No.

f(t) is the integrand, which is [x^3 z] ds/dt, no.

The integral is ∫ g(t) dt, where g(t) = x^3 z * ds/dt = (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46)

But ds/dt is sqrt(46), so the integrand for dt is (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46)

At t=0.5, x=6*0.5=3, z=4-0.5=3.5, so x^3 z = 27 * 3.5 = 94.5

But this is without ds, but in the integral, it's multiplied by ds, but since ds/dt is constant? No, ds/dt is constant because the speed is constant? Is the speed constant?

In this parametrization, the speed is |dr/dt| = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), constant, yes, because it's a straight line.

So the speed is constant, so ds = speed * dt, and speed is constant, so the integrand is constant times the function in t.

But the function g(t) = x^3 z is not constant, but since ds/dt is constant, the whole integrand is proportional to g(t).

But anyway, at t=0.5, g(t) = x^3 z = (3)^3 * 3.5 = 27 * 3.5 = 94.5

Then the integrand for dt is g(t) * ds/dt = 94.5 * sqrt(46) ≈ 94.5 * 6.782 ≈ let's compute: 100*6.782=678.2, minus 5.5*6.782≈37.301, so 678.2 - 37.301 = 640.899? Better: 94.5 * 6.782

90*6.782=610.38, 4.5*6.782≈30.519, total ≈640.899

Now, the integral from 0 to 1, since it's a polynomial, I can approximate.

At t=0, 0

t=1, 864*(1)^3 - 216*(1)^4 = 864 - 216 = 648? No, that's without sqrt(46).

The integrand for dt is (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46)

At t=1, (864 - 216) sqrt(46) = 648 sqrt(46) ≈ 648 * 6.78233 ≈ 648*6.78233

600*6.78233=4069.398, 48*6.78233≈325.55184, total ≈4394.94984

At t=0.5, as above, about 640.899? Earlier I had for g(t) but with ds/dt.

g(t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

At t=0.5, 864*(0.125) - 216*(0.0625) = 864*0.125=108, 216*0.0625=13.5, so 108 - 13.5 = 94.5, yes.

Then times sqrt(46) ≈94.5*6.78233≈640.899, as I had.

Now, the function is decreasing, since t^3 term dominates but with negative t^4.

I could use Simpson or just average.

Since it's a cubic, but anyway, my earlier calculation gave about 1172, but that was for the whole integral? Earlier I computed sqrt(46)*864/5 ≈6.78233*172.8≈1171.986, as I had.

Now, the integral should be the area under the curve of h(t) = (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) sqrt(46) from 0 to 1.

Since it's positive in [0,1], and at t=0.5, h(0.5)≈94.5 * sqrt(46) ≈640.9, at t=0 and t=1, h(1)= (864-216)sqrt(46)=648 sqrt(46)≈4394.95, h(0)=0.

But it's increasing? Let me see the derivative or something.

h(t) = k (a t^3 + b t^4) with a=864, b=-216, but since b negative, but for small t, t^3 dominates, so increasing initially? Derivative of h(t) is k (3a t^2 + 4b t^3), which for small t is positive, but since b negative, eventually negative.

But anyway, the value at t=1 is large, about 4395, at t=0.5 is 641, so average maybe around 2000 or so, times length? The parameter t from 0 to 1, but ds/dt = sqrt(46) ≈6.78, so arc length is sqrt(46)*1 ≈6.78, but the integrand varies.

The integral is ∫ h(t) dt, with h(t) from 0 to about 4395, but it's not linear, but since it starts at 0 and ends at 4395, and is increasing initially, but let me compute at another point.

At t=0.2, x=6*0.2=1.2, z=4-0.2=3.8, x^3 z=1.728*3.8≈6.5664

Then h(t)=6.5664 * sqrt(46)≈6.5664*6.782≈44.54

At t=0.8, x=4.8, z=4-0.8=3.2, x^3 z=4.8^3 *3.2=110.592*3.2≈353.8944

h(t)=353.8944*6.782≈2400. something? 350*6.782≈2373.7, 3.8944*6.782≈26.4, total ≈2400.1

At t=0.6, x=3.6, z=3.4, x^3 z=46.656*3.4≈158.6304, h(t)=158.6304*6.782≈1076. something

Now, so points: t=0, h=0; t=0.2, h≈44.54; t=0.4, x=2.4, z=3.6, x^3 z=13.824*3.6≈49.7664, h≈49.7664*6.782≈337.5

t=0.5, h≈640.9; t=0.6, h≈1076; t=0.8, h≈2400; t=1, h≈4395

Now, from 0 to 1, with values: 0,44.54,337.5,640.9,1076,2400,4395? At t=0.7: x=4.2, z=3.3, x^3 z=74.088*3.3≈244.4904, h≈244.4904*6.782≈1658. something

t=0.9: x=5.4, z=3.1, x^3 z=157.464*3.1≈488.1384, h≈488.1384*6.782≈3310. something

So values: t=0:0, t=0.2:44.54, t=0.4:337.5, t=0.6:1076, t=0.8:2400, t=1.0:4395

This is increasing rapidly. The integral can be approximated by trapezoid or Simpson, but since it's uneven, perhaps use more points or just average.

Note that from t=0.8 to t=1, it jumps from 2400 to 4395, so average about 3400 over 0.2, so integral about 680, but that's only for last part.

Better to use the fact that it's a polynomial, so my exact calculation should be correct.

The antiderivative is correct, and evaluation is correct.

So I think \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\) is the answer.

I can write it as \(\frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}\), but same.

Or factor out, but no.

Notice that 864 / 16 = 54, but not helpful.

So I'll box it.

But in the answer, perhaps they expect simplified radical or something, but it is simplified.

I can write it as \( \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} \)

So, final answer.

But let me see if I can reduce 864 and 46, but since 46 is under square root, and 864 is integer, no.

Another way: \(\sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\)

Yes.

So, I think that's it.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), parametrize the curve. The direction vector from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\) is \(\langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle\). Thus, the parametric equations are:

\[
x(t) = 6t, \quad y(t) = 6 - 3t, \quad z(t) = 4 - t
\]

for \(t\) from 0 to 1.

The arc length element \(ds\) is given by \(ds = \left\| \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right\| dt\), where \(\vec{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle\). Compute the derivatives:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 6, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = -3, \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = -1
\]

The magnitude of the velocity vector is:

\[
\sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dz}{dt} \right)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}
\]

Thus, \(ds = \sqrt{46}  dt\).

The integrand \(x^3 z\) in terms of \(t\) is:

\[
x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4
\]

The line integral becomes:

\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt
\]

Evaluate the integral:

\[
\int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt = \left[ 864 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left[ 216t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 \right]_0^1 = 216(1)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(1)^5 - 0 = 216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{1080}{5} - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{864}{5}
\]

Multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\):

\[
\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{864}{5}\) is already simplified, as 864 and 5 are coprime. The expression \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\) is the simplified form of the result.

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
\]
