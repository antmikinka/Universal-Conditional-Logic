        "Then, compute the magnitude of r prime of t which is the square root of 6 squared plus negative 3 squared plus 1 squared which equals the square root of 36 plus 9 plus 1 which equals the square root of 46.",
        "Now, substitute x equals 6t and z equals 4 plus t into the integrand x cubed z which gives us open bracket 6t close bracket cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket which equals 216 t cubed times open bracket 4 plus t close bracket which equals 864 t cubed plus 216 t to the power of 4.",

        "Integrating, we get the square root of 46 times open bracket 864 t to the power of 4 divided by 4 plus 216 t to the power of 5 divided by 5 close bracket evaluated from 0 to 1.",
        "This equals the square root of 46 times open bracket 216 plus 216 divided by 5 close bracket which equals the square root of 46 times open bracket 216 plus 43.2 close bracket which equals the square root of 46 times 259.2.",
        "Finally, the line integral equals approximately 189."
