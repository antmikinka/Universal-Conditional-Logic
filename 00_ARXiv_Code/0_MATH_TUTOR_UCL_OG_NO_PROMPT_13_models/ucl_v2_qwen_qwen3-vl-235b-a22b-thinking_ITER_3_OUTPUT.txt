=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z ds over the line segment C from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). Hmm, line integrals with respect to arc length. Right, so first, I should parameterize the curve C.

The line segment between two points can be parameterized using a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. Let me recall the formula. If the points are (x0, y0, z0) and (x1, y1, z1), then the parameterization is r(t) = (x0 + t(x1 - x0), y0 + t(y1 - y0), z0 + t(z1 - z0)) for t from 0 to 1.

So here, the starting point is (0,6,4) and the end is (6,3,3). Let's compute the differences: 6-0=6, 3-6=-3, 3-4=-1. So the parameterization should be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t

y(t) = 6 - 3t

z(t) = 4 - t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds. For a line integral with respect to arc length, ds is the magnitude of the derivative of r(t) with respect to t, times dt. So first, compute dr/dt.

dr/dt = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt) = (6, -3, -1). Then the magnitude is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, the integrand is x³ z. Let's substitute x(t) and z(t) into this. x(t) is 6t, so x³ is (6t)^3 = 216 t³. z(t) is 4 - t. So the integrand becomes 216 t³ (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt.

Wait, but hold on: the integral is ∫_C x³ z ds, which becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [x(t)^3 z(t)] * |dr/dt| dt. So yes, that's exactly what I have. So putting it all together:

Integral = sqrt(46) * ∫ from 0 to 1 of (216 t³)(4 - t) dt.

Let me simplify the integrand. Multiply 216 t³ by (4 - t): 216*(4 t³ - t^4) = 864 t³ - 216 t^4.

So the integral becomes sqrt(46) * [864 ∫ t³ dt - 216 ∫ t^4 dt] from 0 to 1.

Compute the integrals:

∫ t³ dt from 0 to1 is [t^4 /4] from 0 to1 = 1/4 - 0 = 1/4.

∫ t^4 dt from 0 to1 is [t^5 /5] from 0 to1 = 1/5 - 0 = 1/5.

So plugging these in:

864*(1/4) - 216*(1/5) = 216 - 43.2 = 172.8.

Wait, let me compute that again.

864*(1/4) is 216, correct. 216*(1/5) is 43.2. So 216 - 43.2 = 172.8.

But maybe better to keep it as fractions. Let's see:

864/4 = 216.

216/5 is 216/5.

So the integral inside is 216 - (216/5) = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5.

Wait, 216 is 1080/5, so 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5. Yes, that's better. So 864/5 is 172.8, but as a fraction it's 864/5.

So the entire integral is sqrt(46) * (864/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Original integrand after substitution: 216 t³ (4 - t) = 864 t³ - 216 t^4.

Integrate term by term:

∫864 t³ dt from 0 to1 = 864 * [t^4 /4] from 0 to1 = 864*(1/4) = 216.

∫216 t^4 dt from 0 to1 = 216 * [t^5 /5] from 0 to1 = 216/5.

So the integral of (864 t³ -216 t^4) dt is 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the line integral is (864/5) * sqrt(46).

Let me verify if I did the parameterization correctly. Starting at (0,6,4), so when t=0, x=0, y=6, z=4. Correct. When t=1, x=6, y=3, z=3. Correct. So the parameterization is right.

dr/dt components: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1. Magnitude sqrt(36 +9 +1)=sqrt(46). Correct.

The integrand substitution: x=6t, z=4 - t, so x³ z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t³ (4 - t). Correct.

Then multiplying by ds = sqrt(46) dt. So the integral is sqrt(46) times the integral of 216 t³ (4 - t) dt from 0 to1. Correct.

Integrating gives 864/5. So the final answer is (864/5) sqrt(46). Maybe simplify 864/5 as 172.8, but probably better to leave as a fraction.

Wait, 864 divided by 5 is 172.8, but in exact terms, it's 864/5. So the answer is (864√46)/5.

Let me check if I can reduce 864 and 5. 864 is 16*54=16*6*9=16*54. 5 is prime, so no common factors. So yes, 864/5 is the simplified fraction.

Therefore, the line integral evaluates to 864 times the square root of 46 divided by 5.
