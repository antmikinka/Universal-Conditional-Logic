**Calculating integral value**

I'm working through the integral which involves multiplying and simplifying terms. I arrived at the expression involving sqrt46 and the coefficients. After some calculations, I confirmed that the integral simplifies to (864/5) * sqrt46. It seems like everything checks out. Next, I’ll think about how to categorize the problem, potentially as a "line integral," and prepare the relevant JSON fields for its representation. I wonder if I've covered everything needed!**Formatting TTS output**

I’m working on providing a spoken format for the main numeric value, which is "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six." I need to remember the TTS rules about expressing square roots correctly and keeping numbers converted to words. 

I’ll also make sure to convert any zeros into words because that’s part of the quality control. Additionally, I need to prepare step-by-step answers in TTS strings while ensuring the JSON output is valid and free of extra symbols. It's important to get this right!**Creating JSON structure**

I'm putting together the JSON structure for the line integral problem, including essentials like problem number, statement, and question type. I've noted the need for TTS formatting by expressing the final answer as "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six."

It seems like I'm considering how "the quantity" could factor into the grouping at level one. Plus, I’ll include a scratchwork sequence with clear TTS-friendly steps, ensuring I follow the formatting guidelines carefully. I want to get this right!**Refining parameterization steps**

I'm working on parameterizing the line with the expression "vector six t, six minus three t, four minus t." It might be good to prepend "the quantity" here. 

Then I've got to compute x and z values. For each step, I want to follow TTS rules, using phrases like "to the power of" for exponents and "times" for multiplication. 

I’ll refine each step so they read clearly, like detailing how to compute x cubed times z by expanding everything properly. I really want to ensure clarity and accuracy!**Crafting JSON for integral calculation**

I need to be careful with my earlier computations. I've realized that when I compute (6t)^3 as 216 t^3, and then multiply by (4-t), it gives me 864 t^3 - 216 t^4. 

I want to phrase this properly for TTS, including "the quantity" where needed. I have additional steps to confirm the integral's bounds and ensure I articulate everything in spoken words correctly. 

I’ll wrap this all up in a tidy JSON format, ensuring all fields are included and no stray characters remain. Let’s finalize that!
