We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
Steps:
1. Parameterize the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
   Let t be from 0 to 1:
      x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t
      y(t) = 6 - 3t   (because 6 - 3t: when t=0, y=6; t=1, y=3)
      z(t) = 4 - t    (because 4 - t: when t=0, z=4; t=1, z=3)

2. Compute the derivatives:
   dx/dt = 6
   dy/dt = -3
   dz/dt = -1

3. The differential arc length ds is:
   ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt
      = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) dt
      = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) dt
      = sqrt(46) dt

4. The integrand becomes:
   x(t)^3 * z(t) * ds = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt

   Note: (6t)^3 = 216 t^3

   So: 216 t^3 (4 - t) sqrt(46) dt

5. Integrate from t=0 to t=1:
   ∫[0 to 1] 216 sqrt(46) t^3 (4 - t) dt
   = 216 sqrt(46) ∫[0 to 1] (4t^3 - t^4) dt

6. Compute the integral:
   ∫4t^3 dt = 4*(t^4/4) = t^4 | from 0 to 1 = 1
   ∫t^4 dt = t^5/5 | from 0 to 1 = 1/5

   So: ∫(4t^3 - t^4) dt = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

   Then: 216 sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46)

   We can write 864/5 as 172.8, but let's keep as fraction.

   Alternatively, we can write: 864/5 sqrt(46)

   But 864/5 is 172.8, so 172.8 sqrt(46). However, let's compute numerically? The problem doesn't specify.

   However, note that the problem is in exact form. We should leave in exact form.

   So: 864 sqrt(46) / 5

   We can simplify? 864 and 5 are coprime, so that's the answer.

   Alternatively, we can factor: 864 = 144 * 6, but no common factors with 5? So:

   Answer: (864 sqrt(46)) / 5

But wait, let's double-check the integral:

   ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5.

   So 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = (216 * 4 / 5) sqrt(46) = 864/5 sqrt(46)

   We can write it as (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

Now, we must output in TTS format.

Note: The problem says "Evaluate the line integral", and we have the answer.

In the JSON, we need to put:

problem_number: Since not given, we can leave as "1" or omit? The problem doesn't have a number. But the template has "problem_number". We can set to 1? Or leave empty? Since the instruction says "extracted_identifier", but there isn't one. We can set as "Unknown" or 1? Let's set as 1.

problem_statement: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x cubed z ds, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

But wait, the requirement is to convert mathematical expressions to natural spoken language. However, the problem statement we are to put in the JSON is the original problem? But the output specification says: "problem_statement": "{{concept:extracted_text:mathematical_problem}}", and we are to convert the mathematical expressions in that to spoken form? Actually, the instruction says: "Transform mathematical expressions INTO natural spoken language". So we must convert the entire problem statement into spoken language.

But note: the example output has the problem_statement in spoken lang? The template says to put the extracted text. However, we are to convert the math notations.

Alternatively, we are to output an answer. The main answer should be the final answer in spoken form.

But the JSON has:
   "problem_statement": "{{concept:extracted_text:mathematical_problem}}" -> so we should convert the problem's math to spoken? But the problem statement we are given is in text with math. We have to convert that.

Looking at the problem: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³z ds", so we convert:

   "Evaluate the line integral" remains.
   ∫_C becomes "the integral over C"
   x³z: x cubed z
   ds: ds (but sometimes we say "d s" or note that in calculus, ds is the arc length element, so we can say "d s" but in TTS it might be vocalized as "d s" or we can say "d of s"? Actually, in integrals, it's common to say "d s" as two separate syllables? Or we can leave as "ds". However, the universal rules don't specify, so we can leave as "ds" or say "d s". But the rule for integral isn't defined? The multiple integrals section doesn't apply because it's a line integral, not double or triple. The condition for multiple integrals has "double integral" etc., so we don't use that. The general rule? We don't have a rule for line integral notation.

Alternative: We can say "the line integral of x cubed z d s over C", but note that in TTS, we can break down:

   We have to vocalize the integral symbol: we can say "integral" or "line integral" as per the problem. The problem says "Evaluate the line integral", so we can say:

   The problem statement in spoken form: "Evaluate the line integral: the integral over C of x cubed times z ds"

But wait, the integral is written with the symbol ∫, so we can convert that to "integral". And the curve C is the region, so we can say "over C". And the integrand is x³z, which is "x cubed z", and the differential is ds.

But note: in the multiple integrals section, we have rules for double and triple integrals, but not for line integrals. So we use the general transformation for integrals? We don't have a rule. However, the problem is about line integrals, and we have a condition for "line integral" in the multiple integrals section? Actually, the condition is for: problem_content contains "double integral" etc. But our problem has "line integral", so we are in that condition? Actually, the condition is:

   ^^CONDITION: {{concept:problem_content}} CONTAINS "double integral" OR "triple integral" OR "line integral" OR "surface integral"^^

So we are under <multiple_integrals_notation>? But note the condition says "line integral", so we use that section.

In the <multiple_integrals_notation> section, it says:

   [[TRANSFORM: {{concept:line_integral}} TO "line integral over curve {{concept:curve_name}}"]]

But wait, the line_integral concept is not defined in the transformation? However, the condition says we are to use this section. And the transformation for line_integral is: "line integral over curve curve_name"

But in our problem, we have: ∫_C ... ds, so C is the curve name? So we transform the entire integral to:

   "line integral over curve C of [integrand] ds"

But note, the transformation for the integral symbol is not provided? However, we are to replace the integral symbol? The transformation says for {{concept:line_integral}} which we assume is the entire integral expression. So:

   We transform: ∫_C ... ds  to  "line integral over curve C"

   But wait, the transformation rule is: TO "line integral over curve {{concept:curve_name}}" — so it only replaces the integral with the words? What about the integrand? The integrand is separate? We must transform the integrand as well.

Alternatively, we can break the problem statement:

   "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³z ds"

   We can split:

      "Evaluate the line integral: " -> remains
      Then we have an expression: ∫_C x³z ds

   We transform that expression:

      The integral symbol: we can consider it as part of the line_integral concept? The condition is that the entire content has "line integral", so we use the transformation for line_integral. But the transformation says: TO "line integral over curve {{concept:curve_name}}" — so it only handles the integral part? But what about the integrand? We have to transform the integrand separately.

   Alternatively, we can interpret the transformation rule as applying to the entire integral expression? But the rule only specifies a transformation for the integral symbol? It's ambiguous.

Given the ambiguity, let's follow the condition: we are in the line integral condition, so we use the transformation for the integral symbol. But note, the transformation for the integral concept is not explicitly given? The rule says:

   [[TRANSFORM: {{concept:line_integral}} TO "line integral over curve {{concept:curve_name}}"]]

   So we are to replace the instance of the line integral (the symbol and the subscript C) with the text: "line integral over curve C"

   Then we have to transform the integrand: x³z and ds.

   For x³z: we transform fractions? No, it's x^3 z. So we follow the general rule: exponent becomes "to the power of", and we have multiplication? The universal rule for multiplication: we just say "times". But the universal rules don't specify, but we can use common practice: "x cubed z" is acceptable? Or "x to the power of three times z".

   Similarly, ds: we can leave as "d s" or "ds". In many TTS, it's "d s". But our universal rules don't specify. However, for integrals, we can say "ds" as two separate letters? We can break it: "d s". But the rule for multiple integrals doesn't specify.

   Alternatively, we can consider ds as a differential and leave it as is? The condition for multiple integrals says: [[TRANSFORM: ...]] for the type of integral, but not for the differential.

   Since the problem is about line integrals, and we have a condition for it, but the transformation rule doesn't cover the differential, we can leave the differential as "ds"? However, the multiple integrals section says: [[REQUIRE: ...]] but that's about integration bounds. Here we don't have bounds? It's a line integral over a curve.

   We don't have an explicit rule for the differential. So we can output "ds".

   However, to be safe, we can break the differential: "d s". In spoken language, it's common to say "d s" for the arc length element.

   So we can say: "x cubed z d s".

   But note: the universal rule for multiplication? We are multiplying x^3 and z. We can say "x cubed times z".

   For the integral: "line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s"

   Also, the points: (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) — we transform the coordinate tuples.

   We have: "from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket"

   We must explicitly vocalize "comma".

So the entire problem statement in spoken form:

   "Evaluate the line integral: line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

But note: the condition says the transformation for the integral is "line integral over curve C", but we have the differential ds still at the end? We have two integrals? Actually, the transformation rule for line_integral only changes the integral symbol part? It doesn't transform the entire expression. So we are left with:

   The transformed integral expression becomes: "line integral over curve C" and then we have the rest: "of x cubed z ds" — but that is not transformed? We must transform the integrand and the differential.

Alternatively, we can interpret the transformation as applying to the entire integral expression? But the rule doesn't specify. To avoid confusion, we can follow:

   We are to transform the integral symbol (∫_C) to the phrase "line integral over curve C", and then we transform the rest (x³z ds) using the general rules.

   For x³z ds:

      x³: x to the power of three, or x cubed -> "x cubed"
      z: z
      ds: we can break as "d s"

   And the multiplication between x³ and z: we can say "times". So: "x cubed times z d s"

   Then the whole: "line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s"

   And then the problem statement: ... where C is the line segment from ... to ...

But note: the integral expression already mentions the curve C, so we don't need to repeat "over curve C" in the problem statement? Actually, the problem statement says "where: C is ...", so we can keep that.

Alternatively, we can combine: the integral expression becomes a phrase and then we have the definition of C. So:

   "Evaluate the line integral: [this is the integral phrase] , where C is ..."

But the condition rule for line_integral transformation doesn't say it replaces the entire integral expression? It only provides a transformation for the concept of line_integral, which we assume is the integral symbol and the curve. So we break the integral expression:

   ∫_C ... ds -> becomes "line integral over curve C" and then we still have the integrand and differential? That doesn't seem to work.

Alternatively, we can consider that the entire expression ∫_C ... ds is transformed to "line integral over curve C of ... ds", but then we still have the differential and integrand to transform. And we don't have a rule for the entire expression.

Given the complexity, and since the problem is not multiple integrals but line integral, and our condition section is multiple integrals? Actually, the condition says "line integral" OR ... so we are in the multiple integrals section? But note, the section is named "multiple_integrals_notation", but it also includes line integrals.

Alternatively, we can use the transformation rule as: replace the integral symbol ∫ with the phrase "line integral over curve" and then insert the curve name? But then we still have to handle the integrand and differential.

But in the rule, it only provides a string replacement for the integral symbol? We must then transform the rest separately.

To simplify, we can handle the entire mathematical expression using the general rules? Since the multiple integrals section doesn't provide a complete transformation for the integrand and differential, we rely on the universal rules.

The universal rules:

   [[TRANSFORM: {{concept:exponent_format:mathematical_representation}} TO "{{concept:base:number_value}} to the power of {{concept:exponent:number_value}}"]]
   But here we have x^3: base is x? Yes. So "x to the power of three" or "x cubed". We can use "x cubed" as commonly spoken.

   And for multiplication: not specified, but we can use "times".

   For the differential: we don't have a rule. We can leave as "ds" or break into "d s". In many contexts, "ds" is broken as "d s".

   For the integral symbol: we are in the multiple integrals section, but it doesn't specify how to transform the symbol itself? The transformation rule for line_integral is about replacing the entire integral with a phrase? But we can also transform the symbol to words? The condition section for multiple integrals doesn't have a rule for the integral symbol? The only rule is for the type of integral (line, double, etc.) and then requirements for integration bounds.

   Since we don't have a rule for the integral symbol, we can rely on the universal approach: we transform the integral symbol to "integral". So:

       ∫_C becomes: "the integral over C"

   Then the entire expression: "the integral over C of x cubed times z d s"

   And then the condition section for line integral only tells us to use the transformation for the type? But it doesn't say we must use "line integral", so we can use "integral" or "line integral". Since the problem says "line integral", we can use "line integral"?

   Alternatively, we can use the transformation rule in the condition section: it says to transform the line_integral to "line integral over curve ...", so we use that.

   So: we transform the ∫_C part to "line integral over curve C", and then we transform the rest (x³z ds) with the universal rules.

   So the integral expression becomes: "line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s"

   But note: the transformation rule doesn't say "line integral over curve C", it says with the curve name. So we replace the entire integral (which includes the curve name) with that phrase? But then the integrand is separate? We have to attach.

   We can interpret: the transformation rule is for the entire integral expression? But the rule only provides a template with a placeholder for the curve name.

   How do we apply? We extract the curve name (C) and then form the phrase. Then the rest of the integrand (x³z ds) we transform separately.

   So we break:

        Integral expression: [integral symbol] [subscript C] [integrand] [differential]

        We transform the [integral symbol] [subscript C] part to "line integral over curve C"

        Then we have the integrand and differential: "x³z ds" -> transform to "x cubed times z d s"

   Then we combine: "line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s"

   But note: in the transformation rule, it says "over curve ...", so we are using that phrase to represent the integral over that curve.

   However, we are adding "of" to separate the curve from the integrand? The transformation rule doesn't specify that. But it's common to say: "line integral over curve C of f ds"

   So we add "of" before the integrand.

   Alternatively, the transformation rule might include the "of"? The rule says: "line integral over curve {{concept:curve_name}}" — so it's a phrase that replaces the integral symbol and the curve. It doesn't include the integrand.

   Therefore, we must attach the integrand after. We can say:

        "line integral over curve C [with the integrand] ..."

   But the standard way is to say: "the line integral over C of f ds"

   So we add "of" before the integrand.

   We'll do: "line integral over curve C of [integrand] d s"

   But wait, we have the differential at the end. So:

        "line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s"

   However, the transformation for the differential is not specified. We can break "ds" into two separate sounds: "d s". In many systems, "ds" in calculus is broken as "d s".

   So we output: "d s"

   Alternatively, we can leave as "ds" to avoid confusion? The universal rules don't specify, so we can choose. Let's break: "d s".

   Also, for the multiplications: we have to vocalize commas in coordinates? We are already doing that: "open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket"

   In the integrand: "x cubed times z d s" — no commas needed.

   And note: the problem has "Where: C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)." — we transform the coordinates as above.

Thus, the problem statement in spoken form:

   "Evaluate the line integral: line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

But wait, we are repeating "line integral" twice? The first "Evaluate the line integral" is part of the original text, then we transform the integral expression to start with "line integral". We can adjust:

   The original text: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³z ds"

   We transform the integral expression to: "line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s"

   So we replace the mathematical expression with the phrase. Therefore, the entire problem statement becomes:

      "Evaluate the line integral: [transformed integral expression], where C is the line segment from ... to ..."

   But note, the transformed integral expression already includes the words "line integral", so we have:

      "Evaluate the line integral: line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s, ..."

   That's redundant. We can remove the first "line integral" if it's part of the phrase? Actually, the original text says "Evaluate the line integral", so we keep that and then the transformed integral expression is a description? We don't use the transformation for the first occurrence? We only transform the mathematical expressions? The first "line integral" is text, so we leave it? The condition is to transform mathematical expressions, not text.

   But in the problem statement, we are to convert the entire statement? We are to replace the mathematical expression (the integral) with the spoken form. The words "line integral" are already in text? So we leave them? And then we also have the integral expression which is math, so we convert that.

   Alternatively, we can interpret: the entire string including text is to be processed? But the instruction is to transform mathematical expressions to natural spoken language. So we leave the text as is? The first "Evaluate the line integral" is text, so we don't change it. Then the integral expression is math, so we convert it.

   So we have:

      "Evaluate the line integral: [converted integral expression], where ..."

   And the converted integral expression starts with "line integral over curve C", so we have two "line integrals". That's acceptable? Or we can note that the first "line integral" is redundant because we are about to define it? But it's common to say "Evaluate the line integral ...".

   Alternatively, we can remove the first "line integral"? But the original says it. We should not change the text.

   So we output:

      "Evaluate the line integral: line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

Now, for the answer:

   We computed: (864 sqrt(46)) / 5

   We must convert this to spoken form.

   Break down:

      864: eight hundred sixty-four
      sqrt(46): square root of forty-six
      divided by 5: divided by five

   So: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, all divided by five"

   Or: "fraction with numerator eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six and denominator five"

   But the universal rule for fractions: [[TRANSFORM: fraction TO "numerator over denominator"]]

   So we can say: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

   However, note that the entire expression is multiplied by sqrt(46) and then divided by 5? We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six" — but that would be (864/5)*sqrt(46), which is the same. But the original grouping is 864 sqrt(46) / 5, so we can do either.

   But in spoken form, we can say: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

   However, the fraction rule: we can also represent as a fraction? We can say: "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five"

   But note: the rule says to transform fraction format to "numerator over denominator", so if we have a fraction, we split. But here, we have a product in the numerator? So we can treat the entire numerator as a product.

   We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four over five, times the square root of forty-six" — but that is not the same order.

   Alternatively, we can leave it as: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six all over five"

   But the universal rules don't specify, so we can choose.

   Let's go with: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

   But note: we can also compute numerically? The problem doesn't require. We should give the exact form.

   Alternatively, we can write as a decimal? But not specified.

   Since the rule for square root is "square root of ...", we use that.

   Also, for the number 864, we can break? But it's a number, so we say "eight hundred sixty-four".

   So the final answer in spoken form: "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

   Or to make it clear as a fraction: "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

   But we don't need "quantity" if we structure properly.

   We can also say: "the fraction eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six over five"

   However, the fraction rule: we transform a fraction to "numerator over denominator". But here, the numerator is an expression (864 sqrt(46)), so we can consider it as a single numerator? Then: "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six over five"

   This is acceptable.

Now, for the JSON structure:

   "problem_number": Since not given, we set to 1? Or we can set as an empty string? The template doesn't specify. But we can set to "1".

   "problem_statement": The entire problem statement in spoken form: "Evaluate the line integral: line integral over curve C of x cubed times z d s, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

   "question_type": We don't have a specific type defined? The problem is to evaluate a line integral. We can set as "evaluation" or "calculation". But the template says "question_type": "{{concept:classification_result:determined_type}}". We don't have a condition that defines the type? We can set as "line_integral_evaluation". But the instruction says to classify? However, the scratchwork will show the steps. Alternatively, we can leave as "evaluation". But to be specific, we can say "line_integral_evaluation". However, we don't have a predefined list. Let's set as "calculation".

   "math_content_check": "yes"

   "final_answers": 
        "main_answer": 
             "type": "expression" or "formula"? Or we can say "exact_value". The value is a number (expression) — it's a constant. We can say "scalar". But the template: "type": "{{concept:answer_category:response_classification}}". We can set as "exact_expression".

             "values": [ "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six over five" ]

        "scratchwork_answer": We need to show the steps in spoken form? The condition for problem_content containing "gram" etc. is not met, so we don't use the specialized step patterns. We do the calculation in the universal way.

        But note: the condition for problem_content having "gram" or ... is not present, so we don't use the Gram-Schmidt transformation rules. We are in the general case.

        We can break down the steps in the scratchwork.

        Steps:

          1. Parameterize the line segment: 
               x(t) = 6t, y(t) = 6 - 3t, z(t) = 4 - t, for t between 0 and 1.

          2. Compute derivatives: dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1.

          3. Compute ds = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) dt = sqrt(46) dt.

          4. The integrand: x(t)^3 * z(t) * ds = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt = 216 t^3 (4 - t) sqrt(46) dt.

          5. Integrate: ∫ from 0 to 1: 216 sqrt(46) t^3 (4 - t) dt.

          6. Factor out constant: 216 sqrt(46) ∫ from 0 to 1: (4t^3 - t^4) dt.

          7. Compute integral: ∫4t^3 = t^4, ∫t^4 = t^5/5. So from 0 to 1: [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

          8. Multiply: 216 sqrt(46) * (4/5) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

        We convert each step to spoken form.

        But note: the scratchwork should be in TTS compatible format, and the universal rules apply.

        We break down:

          Step 1: 
            "Parameterize the line segment: x of t equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, for t between zero and one."

          Step 2: 
            "Compute derivatives: dx dt equals six, dy dt equals negative three, dz dt equals negative one."

          Step 3: 
            "Compute ds: square root of open parenthesis six squared plus open parenthesis negative three close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative one close parenthesis squared close parenthesis dt, equals square root of forty-six dt."

          Step 4: 
            "The integrand: x of t cubed times z of t times ds equals open parenthesis six t close parenthesis cubed times open parenthesis four minus t close parenthesis times square root of forty-six dt, equals two hundred sixteen t cubed times open parenthesis four minus t close parenthesis times square root of forty-six dt."

          Step 5: 
            "Integrate from zero to one: two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of open parenthesis four t cubed minus t to the fourth close parenthesis dt."

          Step 6: 
            "Factor out constant: two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times the integral of four t cubed minus t to the fourth dt from zero to one."

          Step 7: 
            "Compute integral: integral of four t cubed dt equals t to the fourth, integral of t to the fourth dt equals t to the fifth over five. So, evaluated from zero to one: left bracket t to the fourth minus t to the fifth over five right bracket from zero to one equals one minus one fifth equals four fifths."

          Step 8: 
            "Multiply: two hundred sixteen times square root of forty-six times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six."

        But note: 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, so we can write: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

        However, we can also write the final as a fraction: "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six over five" — but in step 8 we are multiplying a constant (864/5) by sqrt(46). We can say: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

        But note: 864/5 is 172.8, so we can also say: "one hundred seventy-two point eight times square root of forty-six" — but we are doing exact, so we keep fractional.

        Alternatively, we can leave as: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six" — but that might be parsed as (864/5) * sqrt(46), which is correct.

        However, the final answer we put is the same expression.

        We'll write the scratchwork as a list of steps in spoken form.

        But note: the scratchwork_answer: "values": [ ... ] — we put an array of strings? One per step? Or one long string? The template has "values": [ ... ] — so we can put each step as an element.

        However, the template doesn't specify the structure. We can put the entire scratchwork as one string? But it says "values" (plural). We can put as an array of steps.

        We'll put as an array of step strings.

Now, putting it all together.

Note: The problem_statement and the steps must be in spoken form without any mathematical symbols.

Let's code the JSON.
