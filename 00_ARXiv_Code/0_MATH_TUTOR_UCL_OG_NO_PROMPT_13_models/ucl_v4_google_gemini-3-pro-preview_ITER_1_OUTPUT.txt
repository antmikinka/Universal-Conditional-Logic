**Defining the Scope**

I'm focused on grasping the essence of the user's request. It's clear I need to tackle image processing, specifically to extract the mathematical problem from an image. My first step will be to identify the integral's components: the text prompt and the mathematical expression itself.


**Decomposing the Problem**

I've broken down the user's request into key components: the image analysis, problem-solving, and JSON formatting for the Text-to-Speech output. I've begun to define transformation rules to convert mathematical expressions into spoken language, including how to handle coordinates, integrals, exponents, and variable multiplication. The next step is to tackle the integral's evaluation, specifically the curve's parameterization and calculating the line integral's value.


**Processing the Image Data**

I'm now deeply immersed in the image analysis phase, breaking down the problem's components. I've successfully extracted both the text describing the problem, and the mathematical expression. I'm focusing on creating the parameterization, and calculating the differential to apply the transformation rules to the line integral. Following this, I will evaluate the definite integral.


**Refining the Solution**

I'm now fully immersed in the problem's solution, starting with the parameterization of the curve.  I've successfully identified x, y, and z in terms of t, and calculated ds. Next, I'll incorporate these values into the line integral, before the final definite integral evaluation. Once complete, I'll then format the results, applying the TTS rules for the final spoken output.


**Formulating TTS Output**

I'm now focusing on formatting the solution and its steps for the Text-to-Speech output. I've broken down the solution, and am applying the transformation rules to create the final spoken steps and answers, taking into account the nuances of mathematical expressions. The output must explain the parametrization, the integral substitution, the indefinite integral evaluation, and the final value, always adhering to TTS constraints.


**Synthesizing the Solution**

I'm now integrating the image processing with the TTS output. I'm focusing on crafting a step-by-step spoken explanation derived from my solution. My current concern is simplifying both the mathematical steps and the spoken output to ensure clarity. The key will be to balance conciseness and completeness for the final result.


**Evaluating Integrals' Structure**

I'm now focusing on formatting the solution for TTS output. I'm taking the parameterized curve, the differential, and the simplified integrand to derive the spoken steps. I'm checking the final answer's value and the overall JSON structure's integrity before formatting the complete output. I will then review the math for accuracy before generating a JSON response.


**JSON Structure Finalization**

I'm finalizing the JSON structure for the TTS output. I'm focusing on "values" for the `main_answer` and the `scratchwork_answer` to align with TTS output. I'll include the "answer_format" field in the JSON structure. Now I'm checking the problem statement, and final answers, to see that they conform to the existing TTS format. After this, I'm ready to proceed with generating the final JSON response.


**Generating Final Output**

I'm now generating the final JSON output, ensuring it adheres to the specifications for TTS.  I've reviewed the problem statement, the calculated final answer, and all supporting scratchwork to guarantee both mathematical correctness and readability for the TTS. I'm focusing on "answer_format" for TTS compatibility.  Once the JSON is completed, the process will be complete.


**JSON and TTS Verification**

I'm now generating the final JSON output, ensuring it adheres to all specifications for TTS, including formatting, lack of symbols in the problem statement, and correct variable naming. I've performed final checks for mathematical correctness in the solution, and I've reviewed the output's readability to meet the user's requirements. The key element is creating the "answer_format" field for TTS compatibility. After a final review of the math, the JSON is complete.


**Fine-Tuning the Solution**

I'm now refining the JSON and TTS output. I'm focusing on "answer_format" for TTS compatibility. I've re-reviewed the problem, the solution's math, and the scratchwork steps to ensure they align with the TTS, including correct variable naming. My final task is ensuring the "problem_statement" adheres to the strict requirement of containing *only* spoken language, with zero mathematical symbols.


**Generating the Final Response**

I'm now generating the final JSON output, ensuring it aligns precisely with the given specifications for the Text-to-Speech system. I've re-evaluated all elements, including the problem statement's natural language, the solution's clarity, and the scratchwork steps, to guarantee a seamless and accurate final product.


**Reviewing Final Preparations**

I'm now completely focused on generating the final, polished JSON output that adheres to all required specifications. I have rigorously checked the problem statement, solution's accuracy, TTS formatting rules, and scratchwork steps to deliver a final, flawless result.


**Refining Final Output**

I'm now generating the final, polished JSON output, and I've meticulously rechecked every element: the problem statement for adherence to natural language rules, the solution's clarity, and the scratchwork steps to create an accurate final product. I'm especially focusing on `answer_format`.
