=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Okay, let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I need to parameterize the line segment. A common way is to use a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1. The parametric equations for x, y, z can be written as starting point plus t times the direction vector.

The direction vector from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). So the parametric equations would be:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t
y(t) = 6 - 3t
z(t) = 4 - t

Next, I need to find ds. For a parameterized curve, ds is the magnitude of the derivative of the position vector with respect to t, multiplied by dt. 

The position vector r(t) = <6t, 6-3t, 4-t>. The derivative r’(t) = <6, -3, -1>. The magnitude of r’(t) is sqrt(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46). So ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x(t) and z(t) into the integrand. The integrand is x³z, so:

x³ = (6t)³ = 216t³
z = 4 - t

Multiply them together: 216t³*(4 - t) = 216*(4t³ - t⁴)

The integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of 216*(4t³ - t⁴) * sqrt(46) dt.

Factor out the constants: 216*sqrt(46) ∫₀¹ (4t³ - t⁴) dt.

Compute the integral: ∫(4t³ - t⁴) dt from 0 to1 is [t⁴ - (t⁵)/5] from 0 to1 = (1 - 1/5) - 0 = 4/5.

Multiply back the constants: 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = (864/5)sqrt(46).

Wait, let me check the integral again. The integral of 4t³ is t⁴, and integral of t⁴ is t⁵/5. So yes, 4*(1^4) - (1^5)/5 = 4 - 1/5 = 19/5? Wait no, wait the integrand is 4t³ - t⁴. So ∫4t³ dt = t⁴, ∫t⁴ dt = t⁵/5. So the integral is [t⁴ - (t⁵)/5] from 0 to1 = (1 - 1/5) = 4/5. Oh right, 4t³ integrated is t⁴, so 4*(t⁴/4) = t⁴. Yes, correct. So 4/5.

So total integral is 216 * 4/5 * sqrt(46) = (864/5) sqrt(46).

Let me verify the parameterization again. Starting at t=0: (0,6,4), t=1: (6,3,3). Correct. The derivatives are right, magnitude sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46). Correct.

Integrand substitution: x=6t, z=4-t. So x³z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216t³(4-t). Correct.

The integral setup seems correct. So the final answer should be (864/5)√46.

Now, converting this into TTS format. The main answer is the value of the integral. The scratchwork should include key steps: parameterization, ds calculation, substitution, integration.

For the main answer, it's "eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six".

In TTS-ready format, the main answer would be "eight hundred sixty-four fifths square root of forty-six". Wait, but maybe "eight hundred sixty-four divided by five times square root of forty-six".

Wait, according to the examples, fractions are "numerator over denominator", but here it's 864/5, so "eight hundred sixty-four over five".

So the main answer is "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

Scratchwork steps:

1. Parameterized the curve: x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, t from zero to one.
2. Computed the magnitude of the derivative as square root of forty-six, so ds equals square root of forty-six dt.
3. Substituted x cubed z as two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t).
4. Integrated from zero to one: integral of (four t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt equals four fifths.
5. Multiplied constants: two hundred sixteen times four fifths times square root of forty-six equals eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six.

Now, formatting the JSON.

Problem statement: Evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³ z ds where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).

Question type: open_ended

Main answer is a single value, type integral.

The main_answer values should be the TTS-ready string.

Scratchwork_answer values are the key steps as TTS-ready phrases.

So:

main_answer.values: ["eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"]

scratchwork_answer.values: [
  "Parameterized the curve as x equals six t comma y equals six minus three t comma z equals four minus t with t from zero to one",
  "Computed ds as square root of forty-six dt",
  "Substituted x cubed z as two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity",
  "Integrated from zero to one to get four fifths",
  "Multiplied constants to get eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"
]

Wait, but the instructions say for scratchwork_answer.values to have key steps as TTS-ready, and only the essential calculation results, not explanations. So perhaps:

"the quantity six t end quantity cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity equals two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

But the problem says scratchwork_answer should have essential intermediate results. Let me check the examples.

In Example 4, scratchwork has "For f(-1,2): Function f of the quantity negative one comma two end quantity equals negative nine plus four times one equals negative five".

So maybe in scratchwork, key results like the integral result and the constants.

But according to the Essential Tracking Rules, scratchwork should have key variables, critical substitutions, essential intermediate results.

So perhaps:

"ds equals square root of forty-six dt"

"integrand becomes two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"integral from zero to one of the quantity four t cubed minus t to the fourth end quantity dt equals four fifths"

"final result equals two hundred sixteen times four fifths times square root of forty-six equals eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

But the problem says "Only results needed for final answer" and "No formula derivations".

So maybe the scratchwork values are:

"square root of forty-six"

"two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"four fifths"

"eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

But need to format as TTS-ready.

Looking at Example 4, scratchwork has full sentences like "For f(-1,2): Function f of the quantity negative one comma two end quantity equals negative nine plus four times one equals negative five".

So perhaps for this problem:

"Parameterization: x equals six t comma y equals six minus three t comma z equals four minus t"

"ds equals square root of forty-six dt"

"Integrand: the quantity six t end quantity cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity equals two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"Integral of four t cubed minus t to the fourth from zero to one equals four fifths"

"Final result: two hundred sixteen times four fifths times square root of forty-six equals eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

But according to the instructions, scratchwork should have only essential calculation results, not explanations. So maybe just the numerical steps:

"square root of forty-six"

"two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"four fifths"

"eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

But the examples show full phrases. Let's check Example 1's scratchwork: "Fundamental trigonometric identity: sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta equals 1".

So perhaps:

"ds equals square root of forty-six dt"

"integrand substitution: two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"integral result: four fifths"

"final calculation: two hundred sixteen times four fifths times square root of forty-six equals eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

But the problem says "Essential Tracking Rules: ... Essential intermediate results - Only results needed for final answer".

So perhaps the scratchwork values are:

"square root of forty-six"

"two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"four fifths"

"eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

But formatted as TTS-ready.

Wait, the answer format for scratchwork is "tts_ready", so each value should be a TTS-ready string.

So:

"square root of forty-six"

"two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"four fifths"

"eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

But the problem says "Only the essential calculation results in scratchwork_answer.values, NOT explanations".

So the scratchwork values would be the key intermediate results as TTS-ready phrases.

So:

"square root of forty-six"

"two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"four fifths"

"eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six"

Now, the main answer is the final result, which is "eight hundred sixty-four over five square root of forty-six".

Wait, but in the examples, the main answer is the simplified form. Let's confirm the calculation again.

216 * 4/5 = 864/5, correct. So yes, 864/5 sqrt(46).

So main answer is "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

Now, check the JSON structure.

problem_number: Since the user didn't specify, but the problem is a single question, maybe "1".

question_type: open_ended.

math_content_check: yes.

main_answer.type: single_value (since it's one integral result).

values: ["eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"]

scratchwork_answer.values: [key steps]

The example 4 has scratchwork as ["For f(-1,2): ..."], so perhaps here it's:

"Parameterization: x equals six t comma y equals six minus three t comma z equals four minus t"

But the instructions say "No formula derivations - Assume formulas are known". So maybe skip the parameterization step and focus on the calculations.

But according to the Essential Tracking Rules: "Critical substitutions - Show only the most important substitutions".

So perhaps:

"the magnitude of the derivative vector is square root of forty-six"

"the integrand becomes two hundred sixteen t cubed times the quantity four minus t end quantity"

"the integral evaluates to four fifths"

"the final result is eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

So scratchwork_answer.values would be those four phrases.

Now, putting it all into JSON.
