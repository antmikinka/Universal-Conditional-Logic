Got it, let's tackle this line integral problem. First, I need to recall how to evaluate a line integral over a line segment. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3). 

First, I should parameterize the line segment. Let's denote the two points as P0 = (0,6,4) and P1 = (6,3,3). The parameterization of a line segment from P0 to P1 can be written as r(t) = P0 + t(P1 - P0), where t ranges from 0 to 1. 

So, let's compute the vector from P0 to P1: P1 - P0 = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Then, the parameterization is:

r(t) = (0 + 6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), where t ∈ [0,1].

Next, we need to find ds, which is the differential arc length. The formula for ds is ||r'(t)|| dt, where r'(t) is the derivative of r(t) with respect to t. Let's compute r'(t):

r'(t) = (6, -3, -1). Then, the magnitude of r'(t) is ||r'(t)|| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46. So, ds = √46 dt.

Now, we need to express x, y, z in terms of t. From the parameterization:

x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t.

Substitute these into the integrand x³z:

x³z = (6t)³ * (4 - t) = 216t³ * (4 - t) = 864t³ - 216t⁴.

Now, the line integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of (864t³ - 216t⁴) * √46 dt. Since √46 is a constant, we can factor it out:

√46 ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt.

Let's compute the integral inside. First, integrate term by term:

∫864t³ dt = 864 * (t⁴/4) = 216t⁴,

∫216t⁴ dt = 216 * (t⁵/5) = (216/5)t⁵.

So, the integral from 0 to 1 is [216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵] evaluated from 0 to 1. Plugging in t=1:

216(1)⁴ - (216/5)(1)⁵ = 216 - 216/5 = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5.

Then, multiply by √46:

√46 * (864/5) = (864√46)/5.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Let's verify the parameterization and the derivative. The parameterization is correct: from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3), so the direction vector is (6, -3, -1), so r(t) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t) is right. The derivative r'(t) is (6, -3, -1), magnitude √(36+9+1)=√46, correct. Then x=6t, so x³=216t³, z=4-t, so x³z=216t³(4-t)=864t³-216t⁴, correct. Then the integral is ∫₀¹ (864t³ - 216t⁴)√46 dt. Factoring out √46, the integral of 864t³ is 864*(t⁴/4)=216t⁴, integral of 216t⁴ is 216*(t⁵/5)=216t⁵/5. So at t=1, 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5. Then multiply by √46: 864√46/5. That seems right. Let me check if there's any mistake in the parameterization or the ds. Alternatively, maybe I can use another parameterization, but this should be correct. Let me confirm the line integral formula: for a scalar function f(x,y,z) over a curve C, ∫_C f ds = ∫ₐᵇ f(r(t)) ||r'(t)|| dt, which is what I did. So yes, that's the correct approach. So the final answer should be 864√46/5.
