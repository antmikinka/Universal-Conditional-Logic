=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). First, recall that for a line integral with respect to arc length, ds, I need to parametrize the curve and then integrate the function along the parameter.

The curve is a straight line segment from point A(0,6,4) to point B(6,3,3). I should find a vector equation for this line. The direction vector from A to B is B - A = (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1).

So, a parametrization for the line can be written as:

\[ \vec{r}(t) = \langle 0, 6, 4 \rangle + t \langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle \]

Where t goes from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and when t=1, we're at B.

So,

\[ x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t \]

\[ y(t) = 6 + (-3)t = 6 - 3t \]

\[ z(t) = 4 + (-1)t = 4 - t \]

Now, I need to find ds, the arc length element. I know that \( ds = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dz}{dt} \right)^2 }  dt \)

So, let's compute the derivatives:

\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = 6 \]

\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = -3 \]

\[ \frac{dz}{dt} = -1 \]

Now, the magnitude is:

\[ \sqrt{ (6)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 } = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46} \]

So, \( ds = \sqrt{46}  dt \)

Now, the integral is \( \int_C x^3 z  ds \)

Substituting the parametric equations:

x(t) = 6t

z(t) = 4 - t

So, \( x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 (4 - t) = 216 t^3 \cdot 4 - 216 t^3 \cdot t = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 \)

And ds = \sqrt{46} dt

So the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{t=0}^{t=1} (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt \]

I can factor out the constant \sqrt{46}:

\[ \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4)  dt \]

Now, I can factor out 216 from the parentheses to make it easier:

864 and 216, both divisible by 216? 864 / 216 = 4, yes, so:

\[ \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 (4 t^3 - t^4)  dt \]

864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 (4 t^3 - t^4)? Let me check: 216 * 4 t^3 = 864 t^3, 216 * t^4 = 216 t^4, but it's minus, so yes, 216 (4 t^3 - t^4)

But t^4 is positive, so it's -216 t^4, so yes.

I could also write it as:

\[ \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4)  dt \]

Now, I'll compute the integral of the polynomial.

Find the antiderivative:

\[ \int (864 t^3 - 216 t^4)  dt = 864 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} + C = 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 + C \]

864 / 4 = 216, yes.

So,

\[ 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 \]

I can factor out 216:

\[ 216 \left( t^4 - \frac{1}{5} t^5 \right) \]

Now, evaluate from 0 to 1:

At t=1: \( 216 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{5} \right) = 216 \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) = \frac{864}{5} \)

At t=0: 0

So, the definite integral is \( \frac{864}{5} \)

But this is without the constant factor. Remember, this is the integral of (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt from 0 to 1, which is \( \frac{864}{5} \)

But I have a \sqrt{46} in front, and also I factored out 216 earlier, but in this calculation, I have the integral as \( \frac{864}{5} \), but let me confirm.

The integral I computed is \( \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = \left[ 216 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left[ 54 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 \right]_0^1 \)

I think I made a mistake here.

Earlier I said:

\[ \int 864 t^3 dt = 864 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} = 216 t^4 \]

864 / 4 = 216, yes.

\[ \int -216 t^4 dt = -216 \cdot \frac{t^5}{5} = -\frac{216}{5} t^5 \]

So antiderivative is \( 216 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 \)

At t=1: \( 216(1)^4 - \frac{216}{5}(1)^5 = 216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{1080}{5} - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \)

216 * 5 = 1080? 200*5=1000, 16*5=80, total 1080, yes. So \( \frac{1080 - 216}{5} = \frac{864}{5} \), correct.

But this is for the integral without the \sqrt{46}. Now, recall that the entire integral is \( \sqrt{46} \times \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = \sqrt{46} \times \frac{864}{5} \)

But earlier I also factored out 216, but I didn't need to because I already computed it.

Notice that 864 and 216 have a common factor. 864 = 216 * 4, so:

The expression inside is 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 = 216 (4 t^3 - t^4)

So integral is \( \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 (4 t^3 - t^4) dt = 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4 t^3 - t^4) dt \)

Now compute \( \int_0^1 (4 t^3 - t^4) dt = \left[ 4 \cdot \frac{t^4}{4} - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \)

So, \( 216 \sqrt{46} \times \frac{4}{5} = 216 \times \frac{4}{5} \times \sqrt{46} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} \)

Same as before.

So the integral is \( \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} \)

I can simplify this. 864 and 5, 5 is prime, 864 divided by 5? No, it's already simplified, but I can write it as \( \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} \)

But let me check if 864 and 5 have common factors. 5 is prime, 864 ends with 4, not 0 or 5, so no, so it's fine.

I could write it as \( \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} \), but perhaps I can simplify 864.

864 divided by 16? Let me factor it.

864 ÷ 2 = 432

÷2=216

÷2=108

÷2=54

÷2=27

÷3=9

÷3=3

÷3=1

So 864 = 2^5 * 3^3

And 5 is prime, so no simplification with denominator.

But in the expression, it's multiplied by sqrt(46), and 46=2*23, so no perfect squares, so it's simplified.

But earlier I thought about the factoring, but it's fine.

I recall that I have ds = sqrt(46) dt, and I integrated with respect to t from 0 to 1.

Now, the function is x^3 z, and I have x=6t, z=4-t, so x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, as before.

Now, the integral is \( \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \left[ 216 \frac{t^4}{4} - 216 \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \sqrt{46} \left[ 54 t^4 - \frac{216}{5} t^5 \right]_0^1 \)

At t=1: 54 - 216/5 = (270 - 216)/5 = 54/5? 54 = 270/5? No.

54 = 270/5? 54 * 5 = 270, yes, so 270/5 - 216/5 = 54/5? But earlier I had 864/5, inconsistency.

I see, I messed up.

The antiderivative is 216 * (t^4 / 4) - 216 * (t^5 / 5) = 216 * (1/4) t^4 - 216 * (1/5) t^5 = 54 t^4 - (216/5) t^5

At t=1: 54(1)^4 - (216/5)(1)^5 = 54 - 216/5

54 = 270/5, so 270/5 - 216/5 = 54/5

But earlier I said the integral is 864/5, which is different. What's wrong?

I see the mistake. When I computed the antiderivative, I have for the expression without the constant, but in this case, the integral of (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt is not 54 t^4 - (216/5) t^5.

Let me calculate again.

∫ 864 t^3 dt = 864 * (t^4 / 4) = 216 t^4, as before.

∫ -216 t^4 dt = -216 * (t^5 / 5) = - (216/5) t^5

So antiderivative is 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5

At t=1: 216(1) - (216/5)(1) = 216 - 43.2 = 172.8, and 216/5 = 43.2, but 216 - 43.2 = 172.8, and 864/5 = 172.8, yes, 864 ÷ 5 = 172.8, and 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5, yes.

But when I wrote 54 t^4 - (216/5) t^5, that's incorrect because 216 t^4 is not 54 t^4. 216 t^4 vs 54 t^4, I confused myself.

216 t^4 is correct, not 54 t^4. Where did I get 54? Oh, I said 216 * (1/4) = 54, but that's the coefficient, but in the antiderivative, it's 216 t^4, which is correct, but when I evaluate, it's 216 - 216/5 = 864/5, not 54 - something.

In my second thought, I mistakenly said 54 t^4, but it's 216 t^4. So at t=1, it's 216 - 216/5 = 864/5, correct.

So no problem.

So the integral of the function part is 864/5, and with ds, it's multiplied by sqrt(46), so total is (864/5) sqrt(46)

But is this the final answer? I think I missed something. The integral is with respect to ds, and I have ds = sqrt(46) dt, and I integrated with respect to t, so yes.

But let me confirm the limits. t from 0 to 1, and at t=0, x=0, z=4, at t=1, x=6, z=3, which matches the points.

Now, the function x^3 z at start: 0^3 *4 =0, at end: 6^3 *3=216*3=648, and ds is the length element, but since it's a line integral, it's not just the values, but integrated with arc length.

I could compute the length of the curve to verify. The magnitude of derivative is sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36+9+1)=sqrt(46), as I have, and the length is integral from 0 to 1 of sqrt(46) dt = sqrt(46), which is constant, good.

Now, so the integral is \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But let me write it neatly. I can factor out some constants. Notice that 864 and 5, but as I said, no simplification.

I could write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But perhaps I can simplify 864/ something, but no.

Another way: since I have 216 * 4 * \sqrt{46} / 5, but 216/ something.

From earlier: 216 * \sqrt{46} * (4/5) = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, same thing.

Notice that in the expression, I have x^3 z ds, and with parametric equations.

I could have used the formula for line integral.

But I think it's correct.

Let me compute numerically to check.

At t=0, x=0, z=4, so function=0

At t=1, x=6, z=3, function=216*3=648

But since it's ds, and the path is straight, but the function is not constant.

The average might be around half or something, but let's see.

The integral is \int_0^1 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) \sqrt{46} dt

Since ds is constant, I can compute the average of x^3 z along the line.

But perhaps compute the integral numerically.

Set f(t) = (6t)^3 (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

Then integral from 0 to 1 of f(t) dt, then multiply by sqrt(46)

f(t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

At t=0, f=0

t=0.5, x=3, z=4-0.5=3.5, x^3 z=27*3.5=94.5

f(0.5)=864*(0.125) - 216*(0.0625) = 864*0.125=108, 216*0.0625=13.5, so 108 - 13.5=94.5, yes.

t=1, f=864*1 - 216*1=864-216=648

Now, integral of f(t) from 0 to 1: since it's a polynomial, we have exact value 864/5 = 172.8

Now sqrt(46) ≈ sqrt(49)=7, sqrt(36)=6, say 6.782? 6.8^2=46.24, 6.7^2=44.89, so about 6.782

So 172.8 * 6.782 ≈ let's see, 170*6.782≈1152.94, 2.8*6.782≈18.9896, total approx 1171.9296

Now, the actual integral should be around that.

Since ds is constant, the integral is (average of x^3 z) times length of curve.

Length is sqrt(46) ≈6.782

Average of x^3 z: since it's a function of t, and t uniform, but x and z are linear in t, but x^3 z is not linear.

The values: at t=0,0; t=0.5,94.5; t=1,648. So average might be (0+94.5+648)/3≈742.5/3≈247.5, but that's not accurate since not equally spaced in function, but for rough estimate.

247.5 * length ≈247.5*6.782≈1680, but earlier I had 1170, inconsistency. I think I miscalculated.

The integral of f(t) dt is 172.8, which is the integral of x^3 z with respect to t, but ds = sqrt(46) dt, so the actual integral is integral of x^3 z ds = integral x^3 z sqrt(46) dt, so it's sqrt(46) times integral f(t) dt = sqrt(46) * 172.8

But integral f(t) dt is the integral with respect to t, not ds.

The length is integral ds = integral sqrt(46) dt from 0 to 1 = sqrt(46) * 1 = sqrt(46) ≈6.782

The average of x^3 z is (1/length) * integral x^3 z ds, but since ds is the measure, average is (1/L) ∫ x^3 z ds

But L = ∫ ds = sqrt(46)

∫ x^3 z ds = ∫ x^3 z sqrt(46) dt

So average = [∫ x^3 z sqrt(46) dt] / L = [∫ x^3 z sqrt(46) dt] / [∫ sqrt(46) dt] = ∫ x^3 z dt / ∫ dt, since sqrt(46) cancels.

∫ x^3 z dt from 0 to 1 is 172.8, and ∫ dt =1, so average is 172.8

Then integral is average times length = 172.8 * 6.782 ≈ as I had, about 1171.9

But earlier I thought average of function values, but that's not correct because the function is weighted by arc length.

At t=0.5, x^3 z=94.5, but since it's closer to start, and function is small there, so average should be higher.

The values at ends: start 0, end 648, but since it starts at 0 and increases, average might be around 300 or something, but 172.8 seems reasonable since at t=0.5 it's 94.5, and at t=1 it's 648, but t=0.5 is midpoint, but function is convex or something.

I could compute the integral numerically.

Let me take a few points.

t=0, f(t)=0

t=0.25, x=6*0.25=1.5, z=4-0.25=3.75, x^3 z=(3.375)*3.75=12.65625

f(t)=864*(0.25)^3 - 216*(0.25)^4 = 864*(0.015625) - 216*(0.00390625) = 13.5 - 0.84375 = 12.65625, yes.

t=0.5, as before, 94.5

t=0.75, x=6*0.75=4.5, z=4-0.75=3.25, x^3 z=91.125*3.25? 4.5^3=91.125? 4.5^2=20.25, *4.5=91.125, yes. 91.125*3.25=91.125*3 + 91.125*0.25=273.375 + 22.78125=296.15625

f(t)=864*(0.75)^3 - 216*(0.75)^4 = 864*(0.421875) - 216*(0.31640625) = let's compute: 864*0.421875.

First, 864 * 0.4 = 345.6, 864 * 0.021875 = 864 * 0.02 = 17.28, 864 * 0.001875 = 864 * 0.001 = 0.864, 864 * 0.000875 = better: 0.421875 = 421875/1000000, but perhaps calculate 864 * 421875 / 1000000

Note that (0.75)^3 = (3/4)^3 = 27/64

(0.75)^4 = 81/256

So f(t) = 864 * (27/64) - 216 * (81/256)

Compute each: 864 / 64 = 13.5, so 13.5 * 27 = 364.5? 13*27=351, 0.5*27=13.5, total 364.5

Better: 864 * 27 / 64

864 / 64 = 13.5, yes, 13.5 * 27 = 13.5 * 20 = 270, 13.5 * 7 = 94.5, total 364.5

Now second term: 216 * 81 / 256

216 / 256 = 27/32, since divide by 8, 216÷8=27, 256÷8=32, so 27/32 * 81 = (27*81)/32

27*81=27*80 + 27*1=2160+27=2187

So 2187 / 32 = 68.34375? 32*68=2176, 2187-2176=11, so 68 + 11/32 = 68.34375

But since it's minus, so f(t) = 364.5 - 68.34375 = 296.15625, matches what I had.

t=1, f=648

Now, use trapezoid or something. But for integral, since it's polynomial, exact is better.

But to check, let me compute integral of f(t) from 0 to 1.

f(t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4

Antiderivative F(t) = 864 * (t^4 / 4) - 216 * (t^5 / 5) = 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5

F(1) = 216 - 216/5 = 216(1 - 0.2) = 216*0.8 = 172.8

F(0) = 0

So integral = 172.8

Now multiply by sqrt(46) ≈ sqrt(46). Let me calculate sqrt(46). 6.782^2 = ? 6.7^2=44.89, 6.8^2=46.24, 46.24 - 46 = 0.24, so sqrt(46) ≈ 6.782 - a bit, but approximately 6.782

6.782 * 172.8

First, 6.782 * 170 = 6.782 * 100 = 678.2, 6.782 * 70 = 474.74, total 678.2 + 474.74 = 1152.94

Then 6.782 * 2.8 = 6.782 * 3 - 6.782 * 0.2 = 20.346 - 1.3564 = 18.9896

So total 1152.94 + 18.9896 = 1171.9296

Now, actual value is \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} = 172.8 \sqrt{46}

Now, the length is sqrt(46) ≈6.782, and if average of x^3 z is 172.8, but earlier I thought average should be integral divided by length, but integral is ∫ x^3 z ds, length is ∫ ds, so average is (∫ x^3 z ds) / length = (172.8 \sqrt{46}) / \sqrt{46} = 172.8, yes.

Now, is 172.8 reasonable? At t=0.5, x^3 z=94.5, at t=1, 648, and since it's increasing, and more weight near end because ds is larger when speed is constant, but speed is constant since ds/dt = constant, so uniform parameterization.

The speed is constant, so the average should be the average of the function over t, which is (1/1) ∫ f(t) dt = 172.8, and since f(t) ranges from 0 to 648, and 172.8 is about 26.6% of 648, and since it starts low and ends high, but increases rapidly near end, so average around 172.8 seems plausible, as at t=0.9, let's compute.

t=0.9, x=5.4, z=4-0.9=3.1, x^3 z=5.4^3 *3.1=157.464*3.1≈488.1384

f(t)=864*(0.9)^3 - 216*(0.9)^4 = 864*0.729 - 216*0.6561

0.9^2=0.81, 0.9^3=0.729, 0.9^4=0.6561

864*0.729: 800*0.729=583.2, 64*0.729≈64*0.7=44.8, 64*0.029=1.856, total 44.8+1.856=46.656, so 583.2+46.656=629.856

216*0.6561: 200*0.6561=131.22, 16*0.6561≈10.4976, total 141.7176

So f(t)=629.856 - 141.7176=488.1384, same as above.

So at t=0.9, f=488.1384, which is higher than at t=0.5's 94.5, and since it's linear in t? No, but anyway, the average is 172.8, and since it's higher near end, but 172.8 is less than at t=0.9, but t=0.9 is close to 1, but there is weight earlier.

The minimum is 0 at start, maximum 648 at end, and since it's cubic, but average 172.8 seems reasonable.

I could compute the integral directly.

Another way to think: since the parametrization is linear, and function is polynomial, it should be correct.

So back to the answer: \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

But I can write it as \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Now, perhaps simplify by factoring.

Notice that 864 and 5 have no common factors, and \sqrt{46} is simplified.

I could write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but maybe they want a boxed answer.

But let me see if I can write it differently.

Recall that in the parametric equations, x=6t, z=4-t, and ds = \sqrt{ (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 } dt = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} dt = \sqrt{46} dt, as before.

The integral is \int_0^1 x^3 z \frac{ds}{dt} dt, but ds/dt = \sqrt{46}, so same.

I could use the formula for line integral without parametrization, but I think it's fine.

Another thought: since it's a straight line, I could use the projection, but that might be more complicated.

I could parameterize differently, but same thing.

Or use vector form, but no need.

So I think \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5} is the answer.

But let me write it neatly.

I can factor out 216: \frac{216 \times 4 \times \sqrt{46}}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}, same.

Notice that 864 / 1, but no.

Perhaps reduce by dividing numerator and denominator, but denominator is 5, numerator has sqrt, so no.

I could write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but in boxed answer, probably fine.

But let me check the units or something, but it's a number.

Perhaps they expect to simplify the fraction.

864 and 5, as said, no common factors.

But 864 can be written, but I think it's acceptable.

Another way: compute the integral with respect to t.

Set u = t, but same.

Notice that z = 4 - x/6? Since x=6t, so t=x/6, z=4 - x/6

Then ds = \sqrt{ dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 }

But dy and dz in terms of dx? Since it's a line, I need the direction.

The direction vector is (6,-3,-1), so the arc length element ds = \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 + (dz)^2 } = \sqrt{ dx^2 + ( - \frac{3}{6} dx )^2 + ( - \frac{1}{6} dx )^2 } ? No.

The derivatives: dx/ds, but better to use the speed.

The total displacement in x is from 0 to 6, but the speed is constant, so ds = \sqrt{46} dx? Let's see.

From the parametrization, when x changes from 0 to 6, t from 0 to 1, dx = 6 dt, so dt = dx / 6

Then ds = \sqrt{46} dt = \sqrt{46} \frac{dx}{6}

Similarly, z = 4 - t = 4 - x/6

So the integral \int x^3 z ds = \int_{x=0}^{6} x^3 (4 - \frac{x}{6}) \cdot \sqrt{46} \frac{dx}{6}

Simplify: \sqrt{46} / 6 \int_0^6 x^3 (4 - \frac{x}{6}) dx

Now, 4 - x/6 = \frac{24 - x}{6}, so

= \frac{\sqrt{46}}{6} \int_0^6 x^3 \cdot \frac{24 - x}{6} dx = \frac{\sqrt{46}}{36} \int_0^6 (24 x^3 - x^4) dx

Now, integrate: \int_0^6 24 x^3 dx - \int_0^6 x^4 dx = 24 \cdot \frac{x^4}{4} \big|_0^6 - \frac{x^5}{5} \big|_0^6 = 6 x^4 \big|_0^6 - \frac{x^5}{5} \big|_0^6

At x=6: 6*(6)^4 - \frac{(6)^5}{5} = 6*1296 - \frac{7776}{5} = 7776 - 1555.2? Better compute.

6^2=36, 6^3=216, 6^4=1296, 6^5=7776.

So 6 * 1296 = 7776

\frac{7776}{5} = 1555.2

So 7776 - 1555.2 = 6220.8? But that's for the expression, but it's 6x^4 - x^5/5 at 6.

But 6x^4 = 6*1296=7776

x^5/5 = 7776/5 = 1555.2

So 7776 - 1555.2 = 6220.8

But this is the integral, but we have coefficient.

The integral is \frac{\sqrt{46}}{36} \times (6x^4 - \frac{x^5}{5}) \big|_0^6 = \frac{\sqrt{46}}{36} \times (7776 - \frac{7776}{5}) 

7776 - 7776/5 = 7776 (1 - 1/5) = 7776 * 4/5 = 31104 / 5

7776 * 4 = 31104, yes, divided by 5, so 31104 / 5

Then multiply by \frac{\sqrt{46}}{36} = \frac{\sqrt{46}}{36} \times \frac{31104}{5} = \frac{31104 \sqrt{46}}{180}

Now simplify: 31104 / 180

First, divide numerator and denominator by 12? Or find gcd.

Note that 31104 ÷ 16? Earlier we had 864/5 sqrt(46), so should be same.

31104 / 180 = ?

First, 180 = 18 * 10, but compute.

31104 ÷ 180.

180 * 172 = 180 * 100 = 18000, 180 * 72 = 180 * 70 = 12600, 180 * 2 = 360, total 12600 + 360 = 12960, so 18000 + 12960 = 30960

31104 - 30960 = 144

So 172 + 144/180 = 172 + 16/20? 144/180 = 16/20? 144÷12=12, 180÷12=15, no.

144 and 180 divide by 36: 144÷36=4, 180÷36=5, so 4/5.

So 172 + 4/5 = 172.8, same as before.

So \frac{31104 \sqrt{46}}{180} = \frac{31104}{180} \sqrt{46} = 172.8 \sqrt{46} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, same thing.

So confirmed.

Now, to write it neatly, I can write \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

Since 864 and 5 have no common factors, and \sqrt{46} is simplified.

I could write it as \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}, but in boxed answer, probably fine.

Notice that 864 = 16 * 54, but not helpful.

Or leave as is.

Another thought: in the beginning, I had the direction vector, and the magnitude.

The integral is \int_C x^3 z ds, and for a line segment, but I think it's correct.

So the final answer is \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

But let me write it as a boxed answer.

But perhaps they want a simplified radical or something, but it is.

I could factor out the constant.

Notice that \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

To make it look better, but I think it's fine.

So I'll box that.

But in the problem, it's "evaluate", so probably this is the numerical expression.

Perhaps compute decimal, but no, exact form.

So \boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}

But let me confirm the calculation once more.

From parametric: \int_0^1 x^3 z \sqrt{46} dt = \int_0^1 (6t)^3 (4-t) \sqrt{46} dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216 t^3 (4-t) dt = 216 \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4 t^3 - t^4) dt

Now \int_0^1 (4 t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5}]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}

So 216 \sqrt{46} \times \frac{4}{5} = 216 \times \frac{4}{5} \times \sqrt{46} = \frac{864}{5} \sqrt{46}

Same.

216 * 4 = 864, yes.

So I think it's correct.


==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
To evaluate the line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) where \(C\) is the line segment from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\), parametrize the curve using a parameter \(t\) that ranges from 0 to 1. The direction vector from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\) is \(\langle 6, -3, -1 \rangle\), so the parametric equations are:

\[
x(t) = 6t, \quad y(t) = 6 - 3t, \quad z(t) = 4 - t.
\]

The arc length element \(ds\) is given by \(ds = \sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dz}{dt} \right)^2}  dt\). Compute the derivatives:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 6, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = -3, \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = -1.
\]

The magnitude is:

\[
\sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 9 + 1} = \sqrt{46}.
\]

Thus, \(ds = \sqrt{46}  dt\).

The integrand is \(x^3 z\). Substitute the parametric equations:

\[
x^3 z = (6t)^3 (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4.
\]

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt.
\]

Factor out 216 from the integrand:

\[
864t^3 - 216t^4 = 216(4t^3 - t^4).
\]

So the integral is:

\[
\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 216(4t^3 - t^4)  dt = 216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt.
\]

Compute the integral:

\[
\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4)  dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) - (0) = \frac{4}{5}.
\]

Thus:

\[
216\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}\) is simplified, as 864 and 5 have no common factors, and \(\sqrt{46}\) is already simplified.

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
\]
