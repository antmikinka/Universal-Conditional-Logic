=== REASONING / THINKING ===

We are given a line integral to evaluate: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 We need to parameterize the curve C. Since it's a straight line segment, we can use linear interpolation.
 Let t be a parameter such that when t=0, we are at (0,6,4) and when t=1, we are at (6,3,3).
 So, the parametric equations are:
   x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t
   y(t) = 6 - 3t
   z(t) = 4 - t

 Now, the differential arc length ds is given by: 
   ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt

 Compute the derivatives:
   dx/dt = 6
   dy/dt = -3
   dz/dt = -1

 Then, 
   ds = sqrt( (6)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 ) dt = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) dt = sqrt(46) dt

 The integrand becomes:
   x(t)^3 * z(t) * ds = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt
                  = 216 t^3 (4 - t) sqrt(46) dt
                  = sqrt(46) * 216 [4t^3 - t^4] dt

 Now, we integrate from t=0 to t=1:

   ∫_0^1 sqrt(46) * 216 (4t^3 - t^4) dt
   = sqrt(46) * 216 [ ∫_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt ]

 Compute the integral inside:
   ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to 1 
      = [4*(t^4/4) - t^5/5] from 0 to 1
      = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1
      = (1 - 1/5) - (0) 
      = 4/5

 Therefore, the integral is:
      sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5)
      = (216 * 4 / 5) * sqrt(46)
      = (864 / 5) * sqrt(46)
      = 172.8 * sqrt(46)

 But we can write it as a fraction: 864/5 * sqrt(46) = (864 sqrt(46)) / 5

 However, for the purpose of TTS, we want the answer in a natural spoken format.

 But note: the problem asks for the answer in JSON with TTS-ready format.

 Alternatively, we can simplify 864/5 to a decimal but the exact form is (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 However, let's write the entire process in TTS-ready format for the scratchwork and the final answer.

 Steps for scratchwork:
 1. Parameterize the line segment: from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) as:
      x(t) = 6t, y(t)=6-3t, z(t)=4-t, for t in [0,1].
 2. Compute derivatives: dx/dt=6, dy/dt=-3, dz/dt=-1.
 3. Compute ds = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) dt = sqrt(36+9+1) dt = sqrt(46) dt.
 4. Substitute into the integral: 
        Integral = ∫ from 0 to 1 of [ (6t)^3 * (4-t) * sqrt(46) ] dt
                = sqrt(46) * ∫ from 0 to 1 of 216 t^3 (4-t) dt
                = sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫ from 0 to 1 (4t^3 - t^4) dt
 5. Compute the integral inside: ∫(4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - (t^5)/5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) = 4/5.
 6. So, Integral = sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5) = sqrt(46) * 864/5 = (864 sqrt(46)) / 5.

 We can also write it as (864/5) * sqrt(46). But for spoken language, we can say the fraction as "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six".

 However, note that the requirement is to output only the JSON. The final answer should be in the "main_answer" and the scratchwork in "scratchwork_answer".

 The problem is identified as an integral problem (question_type). The answer type is a scalar value.

 Let's format the final answer as a string in TTS-ready format.

 Final answer: (eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six) over five

 Alternatively, we can write it as: 864 times square root of 46 divided by 5.

 But we'll break it down as per the rules:

   - Fraction: 864 over 5 times square root of 46.

 However, to be clear, we should say: 
      "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 But note the order: the fraction is 864/5, then multiplied by sqrt(46). So we can say:

      (864/5) * sqrt(46) -> "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

 However, in natural spoken language, we might also say "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six, all over five".

 But the multiplication is commutative, so both are acceptable. However, to avoid ambiguity, we can write it as a single fraction? 
 Actually, it's (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5.

 We can say: "the product of eight hundred sixty-four and the square root of forty-six, all divided by five".

 Alternatively, we can leave it as a mixed expression: "eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six".

 However, for simplicity in TTS, we can break it into:

      Fraction: numerator = 864, denominator = 5, and then multiplied by sqrt(46).

 But the rules don't specify how to handle mixed operations. We are to vocalize in natural spoken language.

 We decide: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

 But note: the multiplication is not commutative in the sense that if we say "over five times", it might be confusing. So we can use:

      "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six, divided by five"

 This is clearer.

 Alternatively, we can write the entire expression as one fraction? Actually, we cannot because of the square root.

 Since the requirement is to preserve mathematical accuracy, we choose:

      "the square root of forty-six multiplied by eight hundred sixty-four divided by five"

 But that has the square root first. We can also say:

      "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six, all divided by five"

 This is the same.

 However, in the calculation we have (864 * sqrt(46)) / 5, so we'll go with:

      "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six divided by five"

 But wait, the order of multiplication: we multiplied 216 * 4/5 first to get 864/5, then multiplied by sqrt(46). So it's (864/5) * sqrt(46). 
 That is the same as 864 * sqrt(46) / 5.

 So, we can also say:

      "eight hundred sixty-four over five times square root of forty-six"

 However, to avoid ambiguity, we'll use parentheses in speech: 

      "open parenthesis eight hundred sixty-four over five close parenthesis multiplied by the square root of forty-six"

 But the universal rules do not specify parentheses. We are to rely on natural spoken language. 

 Alternatively, we can write it as a single expression without ambiguity by changing the order: 

      "square root of forty-six multiplied by eight hundred sixty-four divided by five"

 This is the same. But note that the original expression is a product of a rational number and a square root. 

 We decide to break it down as:

      [square root of forty-six] multiplied by [eight hundred sixty-four divided by five]

 But then we have to say both parts. 

 However, in the context of the entire calculation, the most straightforward is:

      "eight hundred sixty-four times the square root of forty-six divided by five"

 This is the order of operations we did.

 Let's finalize the final answer string as: "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six divided by five"

 Alternatively, we can write the fractional part as a decimal? But the problem does not require decimal, and we want exact form.

 Since the requirement is to preserve mathematical accuracy, we keep the exact form.

 Therefore, the final answer for the main_answer will be the string: 
      "eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six divided by five"

 However, note that the problem might expect a numerical value? But we are in exact form. The problem does not specify.

 Since the problem is presented symbically, we provide the exact form.

 For scratchwork, we provide the steps in TTS-ready format. We break down the steps:

   Step 1: Parameterize the line segment from the point (0,6,4) to (6,3,3) as:
        x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, for t from zero to one.
   Step 2: Compute dx/dt equals six, dy/dt equals negative three, dz/dt equals negative one.
   Step 3: Compute ds equals square root of (six squared plus negative three squared plus negative one squared) dt equals square root of (thirty-six plus nine plus one) dt equals square root of forty-six dt.
   Step 4: The integral becomes: integral from zero to one of [ (six t) cubed times (four minus t) ] times [ square root of forty-six ] dt.
        So that is: square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t) dt.
   Step 5: Distribute: two hundred sixteen times (four t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.
   Step 6: Integrate: two hundred sixteen times the integral from zero to one of (four t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.
        The antiderivative is: two hundred sixteen times [ t to the fourth minus one fifth t to the fifth ] from zero to one.
        At t=1: one minus one fifth = four fifths.
        At t=0: zero.
        So, two hundred sixteen times four fifths.
   Step 7: Compute two hundred sixteen times four fifths: that is eight hundred sixty-four fifths.
   Step 8: Therefore, the integral equals square root of forty-six times eight hundred sixty-four fifths.

 So the scratchwork steps are as above, but note we break each step into a natural spoken language string.

 However, the output must be in JSON and the scratchwork_answer is a list of strings (each step in TTS-ready format).

 We have 8 steps? We can break them as:

   Step 1: "parameterize the line segment from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket as: x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, for t from zero to one."
   Step 2: "compute the derivatives: dx by dt equals six, dy by dt equals negative three, dz by dt equals negative one."
   Step 3: "compute the differential arc length: ds equals square root of (dx by dt squared plus dy by dt squared plus dz by dt squared) times dt, which equals square root of (six squared plus open parenthesis negative three close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative one close parenthesis squared) dt, then equals square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one dt, and then equals square root of forty-six dt."
   Step 4: "substitute into the integral: the integral becomes square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of (x to the cube times z) dt, which is square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of (six t) cubed times (four minus t) dt, and (six t) cubed is two hundred sixteen t cubed, so we have square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t) dt."
   Step 5: "expand the integrand: two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t) equals two hundred sixteen times four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth, that is eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth."
        Correction: 216 * 4t^3 = 864 t^3, and 216 * t^4 = 216 t^4? Actually, no: 216 * (4t^3 - t^4) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.
        So we have: "which becomes two hundred sixteen times the integral from zero to one of (eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth) dt? 
        Actually, no: the expression after distributing 216 is 216*(4t^3 - t^4) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4."

        But wait, in step 4 we have: 216 * (4t^3 - t^4) so we can factor the 216 out and then integrate? Actually, we can factor the 216 out and then integrate the expression inside.

        Alternatively, we can integrate term by term without factoring? 

        Actually, we did: 
            ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt? 
        But note: 216 * 4t^3 = 864 t^3, and 216 * t^4 = 216 t^4? But wait, the expression is 216*(4t^3 - t^4) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.

        However, in step 5 we are distributing the 216? Actually, in step 4 we already have 216 times the integral, so we can write:

            Integral = sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = sqrt(46) * ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt? 

        But that is not necessary. We can integrate without distributing:

            ∫ (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/5) = 4/5.

        Then multiply by 216 and sqrt(46).

        So step 5 might be: "We now compute the integral of (4t^3 - t^4) with respect to t from zero to one: the antiderivative of 4t^3 is t^4, the antiderivative of negative t^4 is negative one fifth t^5, so we get [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from zero to one, which is (1 - 1/5) - (0) = 4/5."

        Step 6: "Multiply by the constants: sqrt(46) times 216 times 4/5 = sqrt(46) times 864/5."

        Then step 7: "This gives us: eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six."

 Therefore, we adjust the scratchwork to 6 steps? Or 7?

 Let me reorganize:

   Step 4: "So the integral becomes: square root of forty-six times two hundred sixteen times the integral from zero to one of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt."

   Step 5: "Compute the integral inside: the integral from zero to one of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt. 
          Antiderivative: for 4t^3: t^4, for -t^4: - (1/5) t^5, so the antiderivative is t^4 - (1/5) t^5.
          Evaluate from zero to one: at t=1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5, at t=0: 0. So the integral is 4/5."

   Step 6: "Then the entire integral is: square root of forty-six times two hundred sixteen times four fifths."

   Step 7: "Compute two hundred sixteen times four fifths: 216 * 4 = 864, then 864 / 5 = 172.8? But we keep fractional: 864/5. Then times sqrt(46)."

        Actually, we don't convert to decimal. So we say: "which is square root of forty-six multiplied by eight hundred sixty-four over five."

 But note: 216 * (4/5) = 864/5, then times sqrt(46) -> sqrt(46)*864/5.

 So step 7: "Therefore, the integral equals (eight hundred sixty-four over five) multiplied by the square root of forty-six."

 We'll have 7 steps? Actually, we can combine step 6 and 7? 

 Alternatively, we can have:

   Step 4: ... 
   Step 5: Compute the integral inside: ... result is 4/5.
   Step 6: Multiply by the constants: two hundred sixteen times four fifths = (216*4)/5 = 864/5, then multiply by sqrt(46) -> 864/5 * sqrt(46).
   Step 7: So the answer is (864/5) times square root of forty-six.

 But we have to be careful: the order is sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5) = sqrt(46) * (864/5). 

 However, for the purpose of the scratchwork, we have 6 steps (from 1 to 6) or 7? We'll do 6 steps:

   Step 1: ...
   Step 2: ...
   Step 3: ...
   Step 4: ...
   Step 5: Compute the integral inside (the inner integral of 4t^3 - t^4 from 0 to 1) -> 4/5.
   Step 6: Then the outer part: sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5) = sqrt(46) * 864/5.

 But step 6 has two operations: 216 * 4/5 and then multiplied by sqrt(46). We can break that? Or not. We can leave it as step 6.

 However, to make each step clear, we break:

   Step 6: "Multiply the constants: two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths."
   Step 7: "Then multiply by the square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six."

 But then we have 7 steps.

 Alternatively, we can combine the multiplication by the constants and the square root in one step? 

 Since the problem does not specify the number of steps, we can have 6 steps by doing step 6 as:

   Step 6: "The final result is the square root of forty-six multiplied by eight hundred sixty-four over five."

 But then we skip the intermediate multiplication of 216 and 4/5? That intermediate step is important.

 We decide to have 7 steps for clarity.

 However, the requirement is to output the scratchwork as a list of strings. We can have as many as needed.

 Let me write the 7 steps:

   Step 1: "Parameterize the line segment from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket as: x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, for t from zero to one."
   Step 2: "Compute the derivatives: dx by dt equals six, dy by dt equals negative three, dz by dt equals negative one."
   Step 3: "Compute the differential arc length: ds equals square root of (dx by dt squared plus dy by dt squared plus dz by dt squared) times dt, which equals square root of (six squared plus open parenthesis negative three close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative one close parenthesis squared) times dt, then simplify to square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one times dt, then to square root of forty-six times dt."
   Step 4: "Substitute into the integral: the integral becomes square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of (x to the cube times z) dt, which is square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of (six t) cubed times (four minus t) dt. Since (six t) cubed is two hundred sixteen t cubed, the integral becomes square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t) dt."
   Step 5: "Expand the integrand: two hundred sixteen t cubed times (four minus t) equals two hundred sixteen times (four t cubed minus t to the fourth) equals eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth. So the integral becomes square root of forty-six times the integral from zero to one of (eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth) dt."
   Step 6: "Compute the inner integral: the integral from zero to one of (eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth) dt. Alternatively, factor out two hundred sixteen? Actually, we can factor the 216 and then integrate? But note: we have already expanded. We can integrate term by term: 
          Antiderivative of eight hundred sixty-four t cubed is eight hundred sixty-four times (t to the fourth over four) = two hundred sixteen t to the fourth? 
          Wait, no: 864 * (t^4/4) = 864/4 = 216 t^4.
          Similarly, antiderivative of negative two hundred sixteen t to the fourth is negative two hundred sixteen times (t to the fifth over five) = negative two hundred sixteen over five t to the fifth.
          Then evaluate from zero to one: at t=1: 216*(1) - (216/5)*(1) = 216 - 216/5 = 216*(1 - 1/5) = 216 * 4/5 = 864/5.
          But wait, that's the same as before? Actually, we have two hundred sixteen t^4 - (216/5) t^5 at t=1: 216 - 216/5 = 216*(4/5)=864/5.

          However, note: we did not factor the 216? Actually, we had 216 already factored out? In step 4 we had 216 times the integral of (4t^3 - t^4) dt, and we computed that to 4/5, then 216*4/5=864/5.

          Alternatively, we can do the expanded integral: 
            ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = 864 * (t^4/4) - 216 * (t^5/5) from 0 to 1 = [216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5] from 0 to 1 = 216 - 216/5 = 216*(4/5)=864/5.

          So the inner integral is 864/5? 

          But wait, in step 5 we expanded and got 864 t^3 - 216 t^4, so integrating that gives 864*(t^4/4) - 216*(t^5/5) = 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5, which at t=1 is 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5.

          So the inner integral (without the sqrt(46)) is 864/5? 

          But note: the entire expression was sqrt(46) * [integral of 864 t^3 - 216 t^4 dt] from 0 to1 = sqrt(46) * (864/5).

          So step 6: "Compute the integral: from zero to one of eight hundred sixty-four t cubed minus two hundred sixteen t to the fourth dt. The antiderivative is two hundred sixteen t to the fourth minus two hundred sixteen over five t to the fifth. Evaluating from zero to one gives two hundred sixteen minus two hundred sixteen over five equals two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths."
   Step 7: "Multiply by the square root of forty-six: the entire integral equals square root of forty-six times eight hundred sixty-four fifths."

 But note: in step 6, the antiderivative is:

        ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = 864 * (t^4/4) - 216 * (t^5/5) = 216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5.

        At t=1: 216 - 216/5 = 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5.

        So step 6 can be: 
          "The integral equals [216 t^4 - (216/5) t^5] from zero to one, which is (216 - 216/5) - (0) = (1080/5 - 216/5) = 864/5."

   Step 7: "Therefore, the original line integral is square root of forty-six multiplied by eight hundred sixty-four fifths."

 This is 7 steps.

 However, we can also note that in step 4 we had the integral as sqrt(46) * 216 * ∫(4t^3 - t^4) dt, and we computed ∫(4t^3 - t^4) dt=4/5, then 216 * 4/5 = 864/5, so step 6: "Multiply by the constants: two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths." and step 7: "Then multiply by the square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six."

 That is also 7 steps.

 We'll use the latter for step 5 and step 6? 

 Actually, after step 4 we have:

   Step 5: "Compute the inner integral: the integral from zero to one of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt. The antiderivative of 4t^3 is t^4, the antiderivative of negative t^4 is negative one fifth t^5, so the antiderivative is t^4 minus one fifth t^5. Evaluating from zero to one: at t=1: 1 - 1/5 = 4/5, at t=0:0, so the inner integral is 4/5."
   Step 6: "Multiply the constants: two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths."
   Step 7: "Then multiply by the square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six."

 But note: the overall structure is sqrt(46) * 216 * (4/5) = sqrt(46) * (864/5). 

 So step 7: "Therefore, the original line integral equals eight hundred sixty-four over five multiplied by the square root of forty-six."

 This is 7 steps.

 Alternatively, we can combine step 6 and 7? But then step 6 would be:

   Step 6: "Multiply by the constants: two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths, then multiply by the square root of forty-six, so the integral is eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six."

 But that is a bit long for one step.

 We decide to keep 7 steps.

 However, note that the problem might be solved without expanding? We can do:

   Step 4: ... 
   Step 5: Factor out the 216: so we have sqrt(46)*216 * [ ... ] and then step 5: compute the inner integral ∫(4t^3 - t^4) dt from 0 to1 = [t^4 - (1/5)t^5] from 0 to1 = 4/5.
   Step 6: Then 216 * 4/5 = 864/5.
   Step 7: Then multiply by sqrt(46): 864/5 * sqrt(46).

 So we have:

   Step 1: ... 
   Step 2: ...
   Step 3: ...
   Step 4: "Substitute into the integral: the integral becomes square root of forty-six times two hundred sixteen times the integral from zero to one of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt."
   Step 5: "Compute the inner integral: the integral from zero to one of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt equals [t to the fourth minus one fifth t to the fifth] from zero to one = 4/5."
   Step 6: "Multiply the constants: two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths."
   Step 7: "Then multiply by the square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six."

 This is 7 steps too.

 We'll use this 7-step version.

 Now, we build the JSON.

 Note: The problem number? The problem says "Evaluate the line integral" and specifies C. We don't have a problem number? 
 But the template says: "problem_number": " extracted identifier, but we don't have one. We can put "1" or leave empty? 

 Since the problem is given without a number, we can put "problem_number": "unknown" or omit? But the template requires it.

 Alternatively, we can put "1" as a placeholder.

 The problem_statement: "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

 But note: the output specification requires the problem_statement to be in natural spoken language with ZERO mathematical symbols.

 So we need to convert the problem statement to TTS as well? 

 However, the template already has a problem_statement field. And we are to transform the mathematical problem to TTS. 

 The original problem statement has math symbols. We must convert it to TTS.

 The problem statement: 
   "Evaluate the line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

 We break it down:

   - "Evaluate the line integral": remains as is.
   - The integral sign: vocalize as "integral"
   - The subscript C: "sub C"
   - The integrand: x cubed z ds: "x cubed z ds" -> but note ds is differential element. In TTS, we need to explain? 

 However, the problem statement is to be converted entirely to natural spoken language.

 We can say:

   "Evaluate the line integral subscript C of x cubed times z differential s, where the curve C is the line segment from open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

 Alternatively, we can use the rules we have:

   - "∫_C" -> "integral over C"
   - "x³ z ds" -> we break: x cubed, then z, then differentiial element s? But in the context, it's a scalar line integral, so we say "x cubed times z differential s"

   For the path: we say "from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to the point open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

 So the entire problem statement in TTS format:

   "Evaluate the integral over C of x cubed times z differential s, where the curve C is the line segment from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to the point open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

 But note: the original problem says "line integral" and then the integral sign. We can also say:

   "Evaluate the line integral along C: integral over C of x cubed times z differential s, ..."

 However, the requirement is to remove all mathematical symbols. So we must replace the integral sign and the differential.

 We decide:

   "Evaluate the following line integral: integral over the curve C of the quantity x cubed multiplied by z, with respect to arc length s, where the curve C is the line segment from the point zero comma six comma four to the point six comma three comma three."

 But note: the integral is with respect to arc length, which we denote by ds. So we say "with respect to arc length s".

 We can also say "differential arc length s".

 Let me write:

   "Evaluate the line integral along the curve C of x cubed times z with respect to arc length s, where the curve C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3)."

 But we replaced parentheses with words? Actually, we are to avoid mathematical symbols. So:

   "Evaluate the line integral along the curve C of x cubed times z with respect to arc length s, where the curve C is the line segment from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to the point open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."

 Now, we create the JSON.

 We note: the question_type is "line_integral" or more generally "integral"? We can set as "integral". But the template doesn't specify. We can set as "line_integral".

 However, the template also has a "math_content_check" that is "yes".

 Let's build the JSON:

   problem_number: "1" (we'll put as a string "1")
   problem_statement: "Evaluate the line integral along the curve C of x cubed times z with respect to arc length s, where the curve C is the line segment from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to the point open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket."
   question_type: "line_integral"
   math_content_check: "yes"
   final_answers: 
        main_answer: 
            type: "scalar_value" (or we can call it "expression" or "constant")
            values: ["eight hundred sixty-four times square root of forty-six divided by five"]
            answer_format: "tts_ready"
        scratchwork_answer: 
            values: [
                "Parameterize the line segment from the point open bracket zero comma six comma four close bracket to the point open bracket six comma three comma three close bracket as: x equals six t, y equals six minus three t, z equals four minus t, for t from zero to one.",
                "Compute the derivatives: dx by dt equals six, dy by dt equals negative three, dz by dt equals negative one.",
                "Compute the differential arc length: ds equals square root of (dx by dt squared plus dy by dt squared plus dz by dt squared) times dt, which equals square root of (six squared plus open parenthesis negative three close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative one close parenthesis squared) times dt, then equals square root of thirty-six plus nine plus one times dt, and then equals square root of forty-six times dt.",
                "Substitute into the integral: the integral becomes square root of forty-six times two hundred sixteen times the integral from zero to one of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt.",
                "Compute the inner integral: the integral from zero to one of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt equals [t to the fourth minus one fifth t to the fifth] from zero to one equals four fifths.",
                "Multiply the constants: two hundred sixteen times four fifths equals eight hundred sixty-four fifths.",
                "Then multiply by the square root of forty-six: eight hundred sixty-four fifths times square root of forty-six."
            ]
            answer_format: "tts_ready"

 However, note that in step 3, we have a complex expression: we break into parts to avoid long complex formulas? 
 But theuniversal rules say to vocalize comma explicitly in coordinates, vectors, etc. But here, the expression is a scalar.

 We have already broken down the formula in step 3 as much as possible.

 But note: the expression "square root of (six squared plus open parenthesis negative three close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative one close parenthesis squared)" is long. 
 We break it into parts? We say: 
   "Compute the square root of: open parenthesis, dx by dt squared, plus, dy by dt squared, plus, dz by dt squared, close parenthesis, times dt"

 And then we break the inner part? That inner part is "six squared plus open parenthesis negative three close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative one close parenthesis squared", which we break in the following part? 

 But we did break it: we said "which equals" and then broke it down.

 Alternatively, we can write step 3 as two sentences? We won't. Our step 3 is already long but clear.

 We'll leave it.

 Also, note: in step 4, we have "two hundred sixteen" and then "the integral ... of (4 t cubed minus t to the fourth) dt". We broke down the inner integral in step 5.

 Now, we write the JSON.

 But note: the scratchwork steps must be in a list. We have 7 strings.

 However, the problem number: we don't have one. But the template requires a string. We put "1".

 Let's output the JSON.
