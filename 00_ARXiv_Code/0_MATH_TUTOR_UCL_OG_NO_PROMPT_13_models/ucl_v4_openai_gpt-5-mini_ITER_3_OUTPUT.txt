**Evaluating line integral**

I think the problem statement should read: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length over curve C, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)." I need to make sure to use explicit commas in the coordinates. I wonder if it can be simplified further. It could also say: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z ds," but I need to avoid using the "ds" symbol and stick with "with respect to arc length."**Evaluating line integral output**

The problem asks me to "evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length over curve C, defined as the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)." The main answer I'm looking for is the exact value which should be formatted as "(864/5) times the square root of 46." I need to make sure to transform this into a spoken representation, like: "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six," while also considering using digits when appropriate.**Formatting the output**

I need to decide on the format for the output. I can express it as "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six" or use digits as "864 over 5 times square root of 46." It’s important to be consistent, using the fraction format as "numerator over denominator" and for the square root as "square root of radicand." The final output should be "864/5 times square root of 46." I also want to provide a step-by-step breakdown in a spoken format with all parameters and transformations.**Structuring steps for output**

I should follow the Gram-Schmidt rules, but that doesn't seem relevant here. I need to ensure that the JSON formatting is valid, with proper escaping for quotes. I'm going to craft the steps in TTS spoken language, separating each step for clarity. 

For example, I can say: 

1) "Parameterize C by r of t equals (6t, 6 minus 3t, 4 minus t) for t from 0 to 1." 
2) "Then r prime of t equals (6, negative 3, negative 1). I want to express negative numbers clearly, so I'll say "negative three" and use digits where possible. 
3) "Norm of r prime of t equals square root of forty-six."**Preparing JSON output**

First, I need to clearly express all numbers using digits, like "46" and "square root of 46." For the differential notation, "d t" should stay simple, and for the integrand, it will be "216 t cubed times (4 minus t)." I want to use proper vocalization for exponents and parentheses, saying "open bracket."

So, I'll structure these details into JSON format:
  
- **problem_number**: "1"  
- **problem_statement**: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z..." with no math symbols.  
- **question_type**: "line_integral"  
- **math_content_check**: "yes"  
- **final_answers.main_answer.type**: "exact"  
- **values**: ["864 over 5 times square root of 46"]  
- **answer_format**: "tts_ready"  
- **scratchwork_answer.values**: I'll keep the steps concise yet complete while ensuring proper JSON escaping. 

Now, let's create the final JSON.
