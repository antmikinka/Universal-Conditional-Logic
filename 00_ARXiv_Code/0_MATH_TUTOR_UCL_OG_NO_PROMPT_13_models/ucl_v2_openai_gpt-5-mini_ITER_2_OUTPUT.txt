**Calculating an integral**

I’m working through the integral of the function from 0 to 1, which involves some polynomial terms multiplied by the square root of 46. After calculating the definite integral, I find that it simplifies down to (864/5) * sqrt(46). There’s also the matter of how to format the output, especially since I don’t have a problem number to reference in the JSON. Should I leave that field empty? That’s something to clarify!**Rephrasing the problem statement**

I’m focusing on converting a math problem into a full natural language statement without using any math symbols. The task is to express "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length over curve C, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)" in spoken terms. I can use numbers but need to avoid symbols like parentheses and multiplication signs. So it should come out like this: “Evaluate the line integral of the function x cubed times z with respect to arc length over the curve C, where C is the line segment from zero comma six comma four to six comma three comma three.”**Identifying answer formatting**

I need to classify the question type as a "line integral," not "multiple integrals." The main answer type is set as "single_value." I’ll now convert numeric expressions into TTS-ready format.

For example, "sqrt(46)" becomes "square root of forty six." The fraction "864/5 times sqrt(46)" could be expressed as "eight hundred sixty four over five times the square root of forty six." I have to ensure that all values are clear and include explicit comma vocalization to meet the guidelines. Everything should be formatted for easy reading!**Formatting answers correctly**

I’m focused on providing the exact expression for my final answer, which will be "eight hundred sixty four over five times square root of forty six" without using any symbols. I might also consider giving the decimal equivalent, but the main answer is the exact value. 

Since the answer type is "single_value," I need to ensure there's only one element in the answer values. I have to include the step-by-step reasoning as TTS strings too, starting with the parameterization of the curve as:

1) "Parameterize the curve: r of t equals open bracket six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t close bracket for t from zero to one."**Preparing the JSON output**

I’m crafting the problem statement without any mathematical symbols, so instead of using x and z, I'll phrase it as "the function given by the first coordinate cubed times the third coordinate." This avoids using letters while still conveying the necessary information.

Next, I need to ensure every step of the scratchwork is clearly stated. For example, I’ll say, "r of t equals six t comma six minus three t comma four minus t for t from zero to one" and verbalize coefficients and exponents correctly.

I’ll write the final JSON, making sure it properly escapes quotes and is devoid of any math symbols, while maintaining TTS ready strings for all entries.
