**Integrating function and format**

I'm calculating an integral from 0 to 1, specifically evaluating the function (4t^3 - t^4). I found the integral value to be (864/5) times the square root of forty-six. However, I want to present it correctly, citing the square root as "square root of forty-six" instead of the numerical format. I should also make sure to follow rules for speaking fractions, saying it as "eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six". The expression isn’t deeply nested; I think I’ll consider it level 1 or 2.**Formatting problem statements**

I need to format the problem statement without including any math symbols. For example, it should be something like: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length along curve C, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero, comma six, comma four close bracket to open bracket six, comma three, comma three close bracket."

I must ensure that I vocalize commas within the coordinates, using "comma" explicitly. I also need to fill in the template fields and check for the problem number, which may be empty or just "1". The focus is on using only natural spoken language.**Structuring the problem statement**

I need to ensure that I format the problem statement correctly, saying "open bracket" and "close bracket" for coordinates. For example: "Evaluate the line integral of x cubed times z with respect to arc length over curve C, where C is the line segment from open bracket zero, comma six, comma four close bracket to open bracket six, comma three, comma three close bracket."

I think I'll classify it as "line_integral" since that's what it is. The math content check will be "yes," and for the final answer, I'll describe it as "the quantity eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six" to keep it clear.**Crafting scratchwork steps**

I need to format the scratchwork answer, ensuring each value is in a step-by-step format. I'll follow the rule of not including any math symbols, so for calculations, I'll say things like "x to the power of three" instead of using "^".

I should vocalize negative numbers clearly as "negative..." and ensure that I explicitly state coordinates by using "open bracket" and "close bracket" along with "comma" for separation. Each step will be a string in the array, covering parameterization, derivatives, the integrand, and integrating the result without any symbols at all.**Preparing final output**

I’m evaluating the integral to determine that it equals two hundred sixteen times the square root of forty-six times the quantity of one minus one fifth. This simplifies to eight hundred sixty-four over five times the square root of forty-six. I’ll make sure to avoid any fraction symbols and use "over" when describing fractions.

I shouldn’t include any mathematical symbols, using phrases like "to the power of" and "times" instead. I’ll prepare the final JSON with proper quoting and ensure all phrases sound natural, keeping it compact!
