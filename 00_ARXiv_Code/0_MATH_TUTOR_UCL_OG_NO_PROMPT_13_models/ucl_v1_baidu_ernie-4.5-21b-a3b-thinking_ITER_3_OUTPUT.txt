=== REASONING / THINKING ===
Let's tackle this line integral problem. The integral is ∫_C x³z ds, where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3). First, I need to parametrize the curve C. Since it's a straight line segment, I can use a parametric equation with a parameter t that goes from 0 to 1.

The starting point is (0, 6, 4) and the ending point is (6, 3, 3). So, the vector from start to end is (6-0, 3-6, 3-4) = (6, -3, -1). Therefore, the parametric equations for the line segment can be written as:

x(t) = 0 + 6t = 6t  
y(t) = 6 - 3t  
z(t) = 4 - t  

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Next, I need to find ds, which is the arc length element. To compute that, I first find dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt:

dx/dt = 6  
dy/dt = -3  
dz/dt = -1  

Then, ds = sqrt( (dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)² ) dt. Calculating the sum inside the square root:

(6)² + (-3)² + (-1)² = 36 + 9 + 1 = 46  

So, ds = sqrt(46) dt.

Now, substitute x(t) and z(t) into the integral. The integral becomes:

∫ (6t)³ * (4 - t) * sqrt(46) dt from t=0 to t=1.

Simplify the integrand:

(6t)³ = 216t³  
So, 216t³*(4 - t) = 216*(4t³ - t⁴)  

Multiply by sqrt(46):

216*sqrt(46)*(4t³ - t⁴) dt  

Now, integrate term by term:

∫4t³ dt = t⁴  
∫t⁴ dt = (t⁵)/5  

So, the integral becomes:

216*sqrt(46)*[4*(t⁴) - (t⁵)/5] evaluated from 0 to 1.

Plugging in t=1:

4*(1⁴) - (1⁵)/5 = 4 - 1/5 = 19/5  

At t=0, all terms are zero. So the result is:

216*sqrt(46)*(19/5) = (216*19/5)*sqrt(46)  

Calculate 216*19:

216*20 = 4320, so 216*19 = 4320 - 216 = 4104  

So, 4104/5 * sqrt(46) = (4104*sqrt(46))/5  

That's the final result. Let me check if I did everything correctly. The parametrization seems right, the derivatives are correct, the ds calculation is accurate. The substitution into the integral looks good. The integration steps also seem correct. I think that's the answer.

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
**Problem Analysis**: The problem involves evaluating a line integral in 3D space. The curve \( C \) is a line segment between \((0, 6, 4)\) and \((6, 3, 3)\). The integral is \(\int_C x^3 z \, ds\), which requires parametrizing the curve and computing the arc length element \( ds \).

**Parametrization**:  
Let \( t \) range from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \).  
\[
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= 6t, \\
y(t) &= 6 - 3t, \\
z(t) &= 4 - t.
\end{align*}
\]

**Arc Length Element \( ds \)**:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 6, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = -3, \quad \frac{dz}{dt} = -1, \\
ds = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} \, dt = \sqrt{46} \, dt.
\]

**Integral Substitution**:
\[
\int_C x^3 z \, ds = \int_0^1 (6t)^3 (4 - t) \sqrt{46} \, dt = 216\sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt.
\]

**Integration**:
\[
\int_0^1 (4t^3 - t^4) \, dt = \left[ t^4 - \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}.
\]

**Final Result**:
\[
216\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}.
\]

**Answer**:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}
\]
