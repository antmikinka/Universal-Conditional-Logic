=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral of x cubed z ds over the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3).

First, I need to parameterize the line segment. The line segment goes from point A = (0, 6, 4) to point B = (6, 3, 3).

A parameterization of a line segment from point A to point B can be written as:
r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t goes from 0 to 1.

So:
r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t((6, 3, 3) - (0, 6, 4))
r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1)
r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t)

Now I need to find the derivative of r(t):
r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude of r'(t) is:
|r'(t)| = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

Now I need to express x, y, z in terms of t:
x = 6t
y = 6 - 3t  
z = 4 - t

The line integral becomes:
∫[0 to 1] (x^3 * z) * |r'(t)| dt
= ∫[0 to 1] ((6t)^3 * (4 - t)) * sqrt(46) dt
= ∫[0 to 1] (216t^3 * (4 - t)) * sqrt(46) dt
= 216 * sqrt(46) * ∫[0 to 1] (4t^3 - t^4) dt

Let me calculate this integral:
∫[0 to 1] (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1
= (1 - 1/5) - (0 - 0)
= 4/5

So the line integral is:
216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = 864/5 * sqrt(46)

Let me double-check this calculation:
216 * 4/5 = 864/5
So the final answer is 864/5 * sqrt(46)

Actually, let me be more careful with the calculation:
∫[0 to 1] (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1
= (1^4 - 1^5/5) - (0^4 - 0^5/5)
= (1 - 1/5) - 0
= 4/5

So 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = 864/5 * sqrt(46)

Let me verify this is correct. The parameterization seems right, the derivative magnitude is correct, and the integral calculation looks correct.

Actually, let me recalculate the magnitude of r'(t):
r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
|r'(t)| = sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

And the integral:
∫[0 to 1] (4t^3 - t^4) dt = [t^4 - t^5/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

So the final answer is 216 * sqrt(46) * 4/5 = 864/5 * sqrt(46)

Let me simplify this:
864/5 * sqrt(46) = 172.8 * sqrt(46)

But I'll keep it as a fraction: 864/5 * sqrt(46)

Actually, let me double-check the entire calculation once more:

Line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3)
Parameterization: r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), t ∈ [0, 1]
r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)
|r'(t)| = sqrt(36 + 9 + 1) = sqrt(46)

x = 6t, y = 6 - 3t, z = 4 - t
x^3 * z = (6t)^3 * (4 - t) = 216t^3 * (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4

Integral: ∫[0 to 1] (864t^3 - 216t^4) * sqrt(46) dt
= sqrt(46) * ∫[0 to 1] (864t^3 - 216t^4) dt
= sqrt(46) * [216t^4 - 216t^5/5] from 0 to 1
= sqrt(46) * (216 - 216/5)
= sqrt(46) * (1080/5 - 216/5)
= sqrt(46) * 864/5

So the final answer is 864/5 * sqrt(46).

Let me check if this can be simplified further:
864 = 2^5 * 3^3
5 is prime
46 = 2 * 23

So 864/5 * sqrt(46) = 864/5 * sqrt(2 * 23) = 864/5 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(23)

This doesn't simplify nicely, so I'll keep it as 864/5 * sqrt(46).
