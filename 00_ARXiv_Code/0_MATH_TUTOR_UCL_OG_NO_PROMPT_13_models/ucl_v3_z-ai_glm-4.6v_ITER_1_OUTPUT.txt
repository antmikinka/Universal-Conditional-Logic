=== REASONING / THINKING ===
I need to evaluate the line integral ∫_C x³z ds where C is the line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3).

First, I need to parameterize the line segment C. The line segment goes from point A = (0, 6, 4) to point B = (6, 3, 3).

A parameterization of a line segment from point A to point B can be written as:
r(t) = A + t(B - A), where t ∈ [0, 1]

So:
r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, 3, 3) - (0, 6, 4)
r(t) = (0, 6, 4) + t(6, -3, -1)
r(t) = (6t, 6 - 3t, 4 - t), where t ∈ [0, 1]

Now I need to find the derivative of r(t):
r'(t) = (6, -3, -1)

The magnitude of r'(t) is:
|r'(t)| = √(6² + (-3)² + (-1)²) = √(36 + 9 + 1) = √46

The line integral becomes:
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 [x(t)³z(t)] |r'(t)| dt

Substituting x(t) = 6t, z(t) = 4 - t, and |r'(t)| = √46:
∫_0^1 [(6t)³(4 - t)]√46 dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 [216t³(4 - t)] dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 [864t³ - 216t⁴] dt

Now I integrate:
√46 [864(t⁴/4) - 216(t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1
= √46 [216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵] from 0 to 1
= √46 [216(1)⁴ - (216/5)(1)⁵ - (216(0)⁴ - (216/5)(0)⁵)]
= √46 [216 - 216/5]
= √46 [1080/5 - 216/5]
= √46 [864/5]
= (864√46)/5

Let me double-check this calculation:
∫_0^1 [864t³ - 216t⁴] dt = [864(t⁴/4) - 216(t⁵/5)] from 0 to 1
= [216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵] from 0 to 1
= 216(1) - (216/5)(1) - [216(0) - (216/5)(0)]
= 216 - 216/5
= (1080 - 216)/5
= 864/5

So the final answer is (864√46)/5.

Actually, let me be more careful about the parameterization. The line segment from (0, 6, 4) to (6, 3, 3) can be parameterized as:
r(t) = (1-t)(0, 6, 4) + t(6, 3, 3) = (6t, 6-3t, 4-t), where t ∈ [0, 1]

This is the same parameterization I used, so the calculation should be correct.

Let me verify the integral:
∫_C x³z ds = ∫_0^1 (6t)³(4-t)√46 dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 216t³(4-t) dt
= √46 ∫_0^1 (864t³ - 216t⁴) dt
= √46 [216t⁴ - (216/5)t⁵] from 0 to 1
= √46 [216 - 216/5]
= √46 [1080/5 - 216/5]
= √46 [864/5]
= (864√46)/5

The calculation seems correct.
