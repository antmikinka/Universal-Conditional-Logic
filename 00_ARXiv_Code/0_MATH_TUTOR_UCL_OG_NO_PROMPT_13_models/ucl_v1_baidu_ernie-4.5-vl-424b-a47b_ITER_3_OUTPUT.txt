=== REASONING / THINKING ===

We are given a line integral: ∫_C x³ z ds, where C is the line segment from (0,6,4) to (6,3,3).
 We parameterize the line segment.
 Let t be a parameter that goes from 0 to 1.
 Then, 
   x(t) = 0 + (6-0)t = 6t
   y(t) = 6 + (3-6)t = 6 - 3t
   z(t) = 4 + (3-4)t = 4 - t

 Now, we need ds, the arc length differential.
   dx/dt = 6, dy/dt = -3, dz/dt = -1
   So, (ds/dt) = √[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)²] = √[36 + 9 + 1] = √46

 Therefore, ds = √46 dt.

 The integral becomes:
   ∫_0^1 [ (6t)³ * (4 - t) ] * √46 dt

 Let's expand the integrand:
   (6t)³ = 216 t³
   So, the integrand is: 216 t³ (4 - t) √46 = 216 √46 [4t³ - t⁴]

 Now, integrate from 0 to 1:
   ∫_0^1 216 √46 (4t³ - t⁴) dt = 216 √46 ∫_0^1 (4t³ - t⁴) dt

 Compute the integral of (4t³ - t⁴):
   ∫4t³ dt = t⁴ | from 0 to 1 = 1
   ∫t⁴ dt = (1/5)t⁵ | from 0 to 1 = 1/5
   So, ∫(4t³ - t⁴) dt = [t⁴ - (1/5)t⁵] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

 Therefore, the result is:
   216 √46 * (4/5) = (216 * 4 / 5) √46 = (864 / 5) √46

 We can simplify 864/5 = 172.8, but it's better as a fraction: 864/5.

 However, we can also write it as (864 √46) / 5.

 Let me double-check the arithmetic:
   216 * 4 = 864, and then 864/5 = 172.8, but in exact form we keep as 864/5.

 Alternatively, we can factor out the constants: 
   The integral is: 216 * √46 * (4/5) = 864/5 √46.

 So, the answer is (864 √46)/5.

 However, note that we can also write it as a single fraction: (864/5) √46.

 But let me check the setup again to be sure.

 Alternatively, we can compute the integral step by step.

 We have:
   ∫ (4t³ - t⁴) dt from 0 to 1 = [t^4 - (t^5)/5] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

 And the constants: 216 * √46 * 4/5 = 864/5 √46.

 So, the final answer is (864 √46)/5.

 But note that 864 and 5 have no common factors, so it's simplified.

 Alternatively, we can write it as a decimal? But the problem likely expects an exact answer.

 However, let me consider if we can simplify √46? It doesn't simplify.

 So, we leave it as 864 √46 / 5.

 But wait, let me check the parameterization and the integrand again.

 We have: 
   x³ z = (6t)^3 * (4-t) = 216 t^3 (4-t) = 864 t^3 - 216 t^4.

 Then multiply by √46: so the integrand is √46 (864 t^3 - 216 t^4).

 Then integrate from 0 to 1:
   ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = 864 * (t^4/4) - 216 * (t^5/5) evaluated from 0 to 1
   = 864/4 - 216/5 = 216 - 43.2 = 172.8

 Now, 172.8 = 1728/10 = 864/5, so that matches.

 Alternatively, we can factor:
   ∫ (864 t^3 - 216 t^4) dt = ∫ 216 t^3 (4 - t) dt, which is the same.

 So, we are confident.

 However, note that the problem asks for the line integral and we have:

   Result = 864/5 * √46 = (864 √46)/5

 But let me write it in a boxed answer.

 Alternatively, we can write it as a fraction times a radical.

 Final Answer: \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}

 However, let me see if we can reduce the fraction? 864 and 5 are coprime, so yes.

 But note: 864/5 is 172.8, and 172.8 * √46 is a valid representation, but fraction is better.

 Alternatively, we can write it as a mixed number? No, it's an irrational number.

 So, we output the exact value.

 Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\dfrac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}}

 However, wait a second: I think I made a small mistake in the expansion.

 Earlier step: 
   The integrand was: 216 √46 (4t³ - t⁴) = √46 * (864 t³ - 216 t⁴)

 Then integrating from 0 to 1:
   ∫ (864 t³ - 216 t⁴) dt = [ (864/4) t^4 - (216/5) t^5 ] from 0 to 1
   = 216 - 216/5 = (1080 - 216)/5 = 864/5? That doesn't match.

 Wait, 216 - 216/5 = 216 * (1 - 1/5) = 216 * 4/5 = 864/5? That is correct? 216 * 4 = 864, then /5 -> 864/5.

 But note: the integral of 864 t³ is 864 * (t^4/4) = 216 t^4, and at t=1, that's 216.
 The integral of 216 t^4 is 216 * (t^5/5) = (216/5) t^5, at t=1, that's 216/5.

 So, 216 - 216/5 = 1080/5 - 216/5 = 864/5.

 Yes, correct.

 Alternatively, we can factor out 216 * √46 from the beginning and then integrate (4t³ - t⁴) to get 4/5, then multiply: 216 * √46 * 4/5 = 864/5 √46.

 So, the answer is \frac{864\sqrt{46}}{5}.

 We'll box that.


==============================

=== FINAL RESPONSE ===
The line integral \(\int_C x^3 z  ds\) is evaluated over the line segment \(C\) from \((0, 6, 4)\) to \((6, 3, 3)\).

### Step 1: Parameterize the Line Segment
Let \(t\) range from 0 to 1:
- \(x(t) = 6t\)
- \(y(t) = 6 - 3t\)
- \(z(t) = 4 - t\)

### Step 2: Compute \(ds\)
Derivatives:
- \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 6\)
- \(\frac{dy}{dt} = -3\)
- \(\frac{dz}{dt} = -1\)

Magnitude:
\[
\frac{ds}{dt} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{46}
\]
Thus, \(ds = \sqrt{46}  dt\).

### Step 3: Substitute into the Integral
The integrand \(x^3 z\) becomes:
\[
x^3 z = (6t)^3 \cdot (4 - t) = 216t^3 (4 - t) = 864t^3 - 216t^4
\]
The integral is:
\[
\int_C x^3 z  ds = \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4) \cdot \sqrt{46}  dt = \sqrt{46} \int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt
\]

### Step 4: Integrate
Integrate term-by-term:
\[
\int_0^1 864t^3  dt = 864 \left[ \frac{t^4}{4} \right]_0^1 = 864 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 216
\]
\[
\int_0^1 216t^4  dt = 216 \left[ \frac{t^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = 216 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{216}{5}
\]
Thus:
\[
\int_0^1 (864t^3 - 216t^4)  dt = 216 - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{1080}{5} - \frac{216}{5} = \frac{864}{5}
\]

### Step 5: Multiply by \(\sqrt{46}\)
\[
\sqrt{46} \cdot \frac{864}{5} = \frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}
\]

### Final Answer
The value of the line integral is \(\frac{864 \sqrt{46}}{5}\).
